    "content": "About Business Ready \n \nBusiness Ready (B-READY) is a data collection and analysis project of the World Bank Group (WBG) that \nassesses the business and investment climate worldwide, accompanied by an annual corporate flagship \nreport. The B-READY data and report aim to promote policies that support businesses, ensure a stable \nregulatory environment, and foster a dynamic private sector that drives job creation and economic growth. \nThrough its focus on private sector development, B -READY contributes to meeting the World Bank \nGroup\u2019s twin goals of eliminating poverty and boosting shared prosperity on a livable planet. \n \nB-READY assesses an economy\u2019s business environment by focusing on three pillars, the Regulatory \nFramework and the provision of related P ublic Services directed at firms and markets, as well as the \nOperational Efficiency with which the regulatory framework and public services are combined in practice. \nB-READY seeks a balanced approach when assessing the business environment : between the ease of \nconducting a business and broader private sector benefits, between the regulatory framework and public \nservices, between de jure laws and regulations and de facto practical implementation, and between data \nrepresentativeness and data comparability. B-READY covers the areas where it can provide the most added \nvalue in the context of existing indicators, namely, the regulatory framework and related public services at \nthe microeconomic level. \n \nB-READY is organized according to ten topics that correspond to various stages of the life cycle of a firm \nand its participation in the market while opening, operating (or expanding), and closing (or reorganizing) a \nbusiness. The ten topics include Business Entry, Business Location, Utility Services, Labor, Financial \nServices, International Trade, Taxation, Dispute Resolution, Market Competition, and Business Insolvency. \nMost topics incorporate relevant aspects related to three cross- cutting themes: adoption of digital \ntechnology, environmental sustainability, and gender. \n \nB-READY collects both de jure information and de facto measures. While de jure data are collected from \nexpert consultations, de facto data are collected from both expert consultations and firm surveys. The latter \nis a major innovation and represents a significant increase in the data available to World Bank Group \n(WBG) teams, development practitioners, and researchers around the world. Data collection and reporting \nprocesses are governed by the highest possible standards of integrity, including sound data gathering \nprocesses, robust data safeguards, clear approval protocols, transparency and public availability of granular \ndata, and replicability of results. Based on the data collected, B -READY generates scores for each topic \nand pillar area. \n \nThe B-READY Methodology Handbook first presents the objectives, scope, and approach of the project. It \nthen provides a full description of the project\u2019s methodology, including motivation, indicators, \nquestionnaires, and scoring guidelines per topic. The Handbook is updated periodically to capture the \nrefinements of t he B-READY methodology in the first three data collection and reporting cycles, as the \nproject expands its economy coverage."

    "content": "CHAPTER 1\u2013OVERVIEW \n \n1. Background. The Business Ready Methodology Handbook develops in detail the B- READY project\u2019s \nindicators, scoring, and data collection methods. This Third Edition of the Business Ready Methodology \nHandbook incorporates methodology refinements that are planned for implementation in the Business \nReady 2026 report. \n \nThe B-READY project is housed in the Policy Indicators Group (DECIG). This Group designs, pilots, and \nimplements the project under the guidance of the WBG Chief Economist and Development Economics \n(DEC) Senior Vice President. The data collection and reporting process are governed by the highest \npossible standards, including sound data gathering processes, robust data safeguards, clear approval \nprotocols, transparency and public availability of granular data, and replicability of results. The \naccompanying Business Ready M anual and Guide (M&G) presents the processes and protocols on the \ngovernance of the project. \n \nB-READY 2026 will be the third report of a three-year rollout phase that spans from 2024 to 2026. During \nthis period, the project grows in geographic coverage and refines its process and methodology. These efforts \naffect its comparability across the rollout years. \n2. Title. As indicated earlier, the title of the project is Business Ready. The acronym is B-READY. \n \n3. Output. The B-READY benchmarking exercise provide s a quantitative assessment of the business \nenvironment for private sector development. The quantitative assessment produce s granular data and a \nglobal report, is published annually, and covers most economies worldwide. \n \nThe global B-READY project is complemented by in-depth country studies, where regional differences and \neconomy-specific issues are analyzed further. Using a similar methodology, they are developed in the sister \nand newly renamed Regulatory Efficiency (DECRE) project. \n \n4. Development Purpose. B-READY\u2019s granular data and summary report aim s to improve the business \nenvironment for private sector development not only by advancing the interests of individual firms but also \nby elevating the interests of workers, consumers, potential new enterprises, and the natural environment . \nTo achieve this purpose, B-READY focuses on three main areas: (1) reform advocacy; (2) policy guidance; \nand (3) analysis and research. \n \nThis strategy is illustrated in figure 1.1."

    "content": "Figure 1.1. B-READY\u2019s Comprehensive Approach to Private Sector Development \n \n \nSource: B-READY project. \n \nIn its advocacy function, B-READY aims to promote economic reforms, opening the door for knowledge \nsharing and policy dialogue for governments, civil society (including the private sector), the WBG, and \nother development institutions. Likewise, by covering a wide spectrum of areas relevant to the behavior of \nfirms and the functioning of markets, B -READY can inform specific policy advice, showing how and by \nhow much economies lag behind international good practices. By providing a rich set of data, B -READY \nsupports social and economic research on the drivers and consequences of private sector development. \n \nPrivate sector development can be defined by three characteristics: it promotes economic growth through \ninnovation and entrepreneurship; it increases equality of opportunities among market participants; and it \nensures the general sustainability of the economy in the long term. Private sector development is driven by \nthe efforts and ingenuity of private entrepreneurs but is critically affected by a range of public policies and \nregulations that create a conducive business environment. These policies and regul ations incentivize the \nstartup of new firms, the facilitation of existing businesses, the creation of good jobs, and the transition of \ninformal to formal workers and firms. \n \nThrough its focus on private sector development, B -READY can effectively contribute to meeting the \nWBG\u2019s twin goals of eliminating poverty and boosting shared prosperity o n a livable planet. The private \nsector is essential to successful development because it is the primary source of employment and a pathway \nout of poverty, including in fragile and conflict-affected states. \n \n5. Approach. B-READY\u2019s approach aims to strike a good balance on the most salient dimensions of a \nbusiness environment assessment (figure 1.2), as recommended by the External Panel Review.1 Appendix \n1.1 presents the key features of Business Ready and its predecessor, the discontinued Doing Business.2 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n1 An External Panel Review at the WBG refers to an independent assessment conducted by a group of external experts. The External \nPanel Review for B-READY assessed the methodology and recommended safeguards and improvements to the new approach. \n2 The project\u2019s Concept Note expands on the similarities and differences between the B-READY project and Doing Business."

    "content": "Figure 1.2. B-READY Seeks a Balanced Approach when Assessing the Business Environment \n \n Source: B-READY project. \n \nFirst, B-READY evaluates the business environment not only from the perspective of an individual firm\u2019s \nability to conduct business but also from the standpoint of private sector development as a whole (including \nworkers, consumers, new enterprises and the natural environment). Recognizing that there is a tension \nbetween the costs to individual firms and social benefits and desirable standards, B -READY includes \ndifferent indicators that address these different perspectives and are scored accordingly. \n \nSecond, B-READY looks not only at the regulatory burden on firms but also at the quality of regulations \nand the provision of related public services over the course of the firms\u2019 life cycle. This balance provides a \nmore nuanced and positive perspective on the role of governments in creating a conducive business \nenvironment. \n \nThird, B-READY collects not only de jure information (that is, according to statutory laws and regulations) \nbut also de facto measurements (that is, reflecting practical implementation). B-READY obtains data from \nboth expert consultations and firm -level surveys. Relying on nationally representative firm surveys is a \nmajor innovation with respect to previous benchmarking exercises, as it considers first-hand information \ncoming from firms\u2019 own experience facing the business regulatory environment (see Appendix 1.2). \n \nFourth, B-READY attempts to balance data comparability across economies and data representativeness \nwithin a given economy. Expert consultations address this balance by using broad parameters , instead of \nnarrow case studies, to measure the business environment that most firms face. Firm-level surveys address \nthe balance by using nationally representative samples of registered firms. B- READY, therefore, covers \ninformation relevant to firms of different sizes and locations, various economic sectors, and foreign and \ndomestic ownership."

    "content": "B-READY does not favor any particular economic system or legal tradition but rather maintains a pragmatic \napproach, focusing on well-founded good practices and standards applicable at all levels of development. \nGood practices are based on internationally recognized standards established by the WBG, other \nmultilateral organizations and specialized bodies, or relevant literature. \n \nB-READY is designed for comparability across economies and over time. This requires the application of \na homogeneous methodology across economies in different geographic locations, and with different income \nlevels and development statuses . By proposing good practices as the measurement anchor, B -READY \nestablishes the gaps that economies at all stages of development can aspire to close. Good practices that can \nbe considered global standards are used to construct cardinal scores to measure absolute differences across \neconomies and over time. \n \n6. Scope. B-READY assesses the economy\u2019s business environment by focusing on the regulatory \nframework and the provision of related public services for firms and markets, as well as the operational \nefficiency with which they are combined in practice (figure 1.3). \n \nThe business environment can be defined as the set of conditions outside a firm\u2019s control that have a \nsignificant influence on how businesses behave and perform throughout their life cycle. This set of \nconditions can be very large, from macroeconomic policy to microeconomic rules. To differentiate the B -\nREADY benchmarking exercise from other well -established international measures, B -READY \nconcentrates on the regulatory framework and public service provision at the microeconomic level: that is, \nas enacted and implemented to directly affect firms\u2019 behavior and performance. \n \nB-READY\u2019s three pillars\u2014the Regulatory Framework, Public Services, and Operational Efficiency\u2014can \nbe defined as follows. The Regulatory Framework comprises the rules and regulations that firms must \nfollow as they open, operate, and close a business. Public Services refers to both the facilities that \ngovernments provide directly or through private firms to support compliance with regulations and the \ncritical institutions and infrastructure that enable business activities. Public services considered by B -\nREADY are limited to the scope of the business environmental areas related to the life cycle of the firm, as \ndescribed below. Lastly, Operational Efficiency comprises both the ease of compliance with the regulatory \nframework and the effective use of public services directly relevant to firms."

B -READY Measures the Regulatory Framework, Public Services, and Operational \nEfficiency for Firms and Markets \n \n \nSource: B-READY project. \n \nB-READY does not include other aspects of the business environment that are well covered by other \nindicators, including macroeconomic conditions ( such as Global Economic Prospects ), government \ncorruption and accountability (such as the Worldwide Governance Indicators), human capital (such as the \nHuman Capital Index), or conflict, crime, and violence (such as United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime \nStatistics). \n \n7. Topics. B-READY is organized according to topics that correspond to various stages of the life cycle of \na firm and its participation in the market: opening, operating (or expanding), and closing (or reorganizing) \na business. The ten topics in B-READY are Business Entry, Business Location, Utility Services, Labor, \nFinancial Services, International Trade, Taxation, Dispute Resolution, Market Competition, and Business \nInsolvency (figure 1.4). For analytical purposes, the topics can be grouped into three broad domains: Inputs \n(Business Location, Labor, Financial Services, Utility Services), which relate to the production function; \nMarkets (Business Entry, International Trade, Market Competition), which focus on firm behavior within \ntheir operating environment; and Institutions (Taxation, Dispute Resolution, Business Insolvency), which \naddress interactions between firms and the state. This grouping serves as a flexible framework for analysis \nrather than a rigid classification. \n \nWithin each of the ten topics, B -READY includes data on three critical themes: digital adoption, \nenvironmental sustainability, and gender. On digital adoption, most topics include, for instance, the \nassessment of electronic windows and online one- stop shops. On environmental sustainability, topics \ninclude the assessment of environmental licenses and the presence of carbon pricing instruments, among \nothers. Finally, B-READY includes data on the gender dimension of the business environment in a manner \nthat complements the Women, Business, and the Law (WBL) project, also housed in DECIG. \n \n Figure 1.4.

The topics \nare interconnected. This figure is not intended to represent a linear progression in a firm\u2019s life cycle or to strictly \nsuggest that these phases ought to be the exact ones, but to give an overall assessment of the business environment of \nthe typical stages of the life cycle of a firm. \n \nThe selection of topics is guided by the threefold purpose of the B -READY project of advocating policy \nreform, informing specific policy advice, and providing data for development policy research. The selection \nof topics meets the following criteria: \n \nRelevance. Each selected topic has extensive economic research that demonstrates its impact on and close \nrelationship with private sector development. \n \nValue added. Measuring indicators within each selected topic fills an existing data gap. B -READY adds \nvalue by producing a unique primary dataset with worldwide coverage and comparability. \n \nComplementarity. Since comprehensive reforms are more likely to succeed, B -READY considers topics \nthat complement one another, using the life cycle of a firm as the common thread. \n \n8. Indicators. B-READY analyzes nearly 1,200 indicators across all topics and pillars. The next sections \nof the Methodology Handbook present them in detail. For each topic, there are three sets of indicators, one \nfor each pillar . Indicators on the Regulatory Framework pillar and Public S ervices pillar are collected \nthrough expert consultations, whereas indicators on the Operational Efficiency pillar are assessed through \nexpert consultations and firm-level surveys. \n \nThe selection of topic indicators relies on the same criteria as the topics themselves: relevance, value added, \nand complementarity. In addition, the indicators have five characteristics:"

They do not, however, attempt to measure the final \noutcomes of the business environment (for example, productivity, formality, equity, and sustainability). \nThese outcomes are the complex result of variables encompassing not only the business environment but \nalso other public policy areas and exogenous factors. As such, they are beyond the scope of the B-READY \nproject. \n \n9. Scoring. Quantifying business environment conditions into corresponding measurable indicators is \ncritical for the B -READY benchmarking exercise. All data obtained from either experts or firms are \ncollected in raw form and then converted to a score that can be combined with other scores. The objective \nof the scoring methodology of raw data is to allow for score aggregation that preserves absolute cardinal \ndifferences, which can be used to compare across economies and over time (rather than purely ordinal or \nrelative scoring). \n \nThe granular data produced by the B-READY project are combined to produce a score for each of the ten \nB-READY topics. Every topic score is generated by averaging the scores assigned to each of the three \npillars (Regulatory Framework, Public Services, and Operational Efficiency) for that topic. For nearly all \nindicators, the Regulatory Framework pillar captures de jure information, and the Public S ervices and \nOperational E fficiency pillars capture de facto information . T he scoring approach therefore provides \ncomplementarity between de jure laws and regulations and de facto practical implementation. \n \nFor all topic areas, the scores assigned to each of the three pillars are built from points awarded at the most \nbasic indicator level. At this level of detail, scoring considers the perspectives of firms (firm flexibility) and \nbroader public interests (social benefits). Considering both private and social interests is important for B -\nREADY because the project must address not only the ease of doing business for individual firms but also \nthe inclusive and sustainable aspects of private sector development. \n \nThe score for each indicator reflects the points awarded to that indicator under firm flexibility and/or social \nbenefits. An indicator is scored under firm flexibility if it affects the benefits or costs of running a business. \nAn indicator is scored under social benefits if its effects go beyond the firm and extend to socially desirable \noutcomes, such as environmental protection, workers\u2019 welfare, market competition, consumer protection, \nfiscal sustainability, equal access to business opportunities, and informational externalities. \n \nSpecifically, points are assigned only to indicators that represent a clear effect on firms (under firm \nflexibility) and/or society (under social benefits), based on internationally recognized and well-established"

    "content": "good practices. Measures that have an ambiguous or contradictory impact on firm flexibility (for example, \nsubsidies for specific exporting sectors) are not assigned firm flexibility points. Similarly, measures that \nhave an ambiguous or inconsistent impact on social benefits (for example , firing restrictions that may \nbenefit incumbent formal workers but harm the prospects of the unemployed and informal workers) are not \nassigned social benefits points. \n \nSome indicators may merit both firm flexibility and social benefits points. For example, clear tax provisions \nare a benefit to both individual firms (by simplifying compliance) and society more generally (by \nstrengthening trust and social contracts). In this case, when points on firm flexibility and social benefits are \nallocated, they are added together. \n \nThe assignment of firm flexibility and/or social benefits points to the selected indicators is done consistently \nacross all economies, reflects the best available evidence from academic literature and well-founded good \npractices, and has been reviewed by an advisory group. The assignment of points is documented in detail \nin this Methodology Handbook (and summarized in Appendix 1.3). \n \nWhen using B-READY data for economic analysis, their interpretation should be contextualized as needed. \nFor instance, when an economy\u2019s shortcomings are assessed, it may be necessary to compare its data \nrelative to economies at similar levels of income or to economies that have followed a desirable \ndevelopment path. Economic analysis should take into account economy-specific enforcement capacity and \ndevelopment priorities. However, this line of analytical work is beyond the scope of the B-READY project \nas a data collection exercise\u2014it should be undertaken by practitioners and researchers, using B -READY \ndata among other complementary data sources. \n \nSummary of results. B-READY is designed for benchmarking across economies . This requires the \napplication of a homogeneous methodology across economies at different income levels and in different \ngeographic locations. It also requires quantifying the business environment conditions using indicators that \ncan be aggregated into comparable scores. \n \nB-READY granular data provide a wealth of information that can be used to guide specific policy reform. \nThese data are presented in the main body of the report and, in more detail, in the Business Ready Website \nthrough accessible facilities and tools, including economy profiles. \n \nIn addition, to facilitate international benchmarking, these granular data are used to obtain topic -specific \npillar scores, topic scores, and overall pillar scores. A topic- specific pillar score is built from the points \nassigned to sets of indicators, organized in categories by subject matter. Each score can range from 0 to 100 \n(where 100 represents the best performance). Within each topic, there are three topic -specific pillars: \nRegulatory Framework, Public Services, and Operational Efficiency. The average of the three topic-specific \npillar scores, in turn, equals the topic score . Each overall pillar score is the average of the corresponding \ntopic-specific pillar scores across the ten B-READY topics. \n \nThe way B- READY results are presented is also important to mitigate concerns about \u201cunhealthy\u201d \ncompetition across economies. B -READY reports address these concerns by avoiding excessive hype \naround economy rankings. B-READY divides economies into five equal groupings (quintiles), from highest \nto lowest performers, based on their scores within each pillar, and presents data by quintile. A similar \napproach is used for presenting the performance of economies by quintiles of the topic scores. This \napproach enhances the understanding of the distribution of the data, facilitates the identification of patterns \nand trends, and improves the ease of communication. It allows readers to observe absolute performance \n(pillar score and topic score) and relative performance (quintile groups). It also can help policymakers \nreadily identify areas for improvement in their economy in terms of regulations, public services, and \noperational efficiency, as well as in specific topics."

    "content": "10. Data Sources. B-READY obtains data from both expert consultations and firm-level surveys. De jure \ndata are collected from consultations with expert contributors, and de facto data are collected from \nconsultations with expert contributors or firm -level surveys, depending on the nature of the specific \nindicator. \n \nThrough the expert consultation process, B -READY collects data directly by sending detailed topic \nquestionnaires to private sector experts in all measured economies through a survey software. Private sector \nexperts include sole practitioners (for example, a self -employed electric al contractor or a lawyer) and \npractitioners working in small, medium, or large firms. Expert consultations ask experts questions about \nexisting laws and regulations, as well as the experience of the same stylized firm across econom ies \n(Appendix 1.4). \n \nIn exceptional cases, B-READY also collects information on features of public services from public sector \nexperts who work for government agencies or ministries involved in the specific processes covered by each \ntopic, as only they would know the answer to some questions (such as credit registries). \n \nThe World Bank Enterprise Surveys (WBES) questions are the source of the B-READY firm-level survey \ndata (Appendix 1.2), which comes from relevant variables in existing global WBES, as well as more than \n75 B-READY-specific questions, cutting across most topic areas, designed to give de facto information on \nthe operational efficiency pillar of the B -READY project.\n Detailed information on the implementation of \nfirm-level surveys, firm sample selection, and administration and management by the WBES Team can be \nfound in the WBES Manual and Guide. \n \nEvery topic chapter in this document contains a section that provides details on the data collection sources \nfor each of its pillars. The Business Ready Manual and Guide (M&G) also provides detailed information \non the experts\u2019 selection process. \n \n11. Integrity and Transparency. The B-READY data collection and reporting process are governed by \nthe highest possible standards of data integrity , including sound data -gathering processes, robust data \nsafeguards, and clear approval protocols. In addition, B-READY relies on transparency and replicability to \nbuild trust in its data and report. All granular data collected by the B-READY project are publicly available \non its website, where all results presented in its reports are replicable using straightforward toolkits. \n \nThe B -READY project follow s the World Bank Group\u2019s guidelines on Accountability and Decision \nMaking (ADM) framework for WBG corporate flagship products. Furthermore, DECIG engages with \nGroup Internal Audit (GIA), Ethics and Business Conduct ( EBC), and Information and Technology \nSolutions (ITS) units at the WBG to strengthen the governance of the B -READY project. To identify and \nprevent process vulnerabilities: GIA provides design and assurance reviews of the end-to-end process of \ndata collection and reporting processes; EBC advises on ways to protect the project from undue influence \nfrom internal and external stakeholders and provides guidance to avoid potential conflicts of interest within \nthe B-READY team and in its relationship with the rest of the WBG ; and ITS supports B-READY to \nmaintain a safe and reliable data management system that protects the data from cyber threats and unforced \nerrors while also allowing for public data availability. \n \nThe governance of the B-READY project is set forth in its companion Business Ready Manual and Guide \n(M&G). The M&G is publicly available on the B-READY website and establishes the protocols, \nsafeguards, processes, and resources related to B-READY governance. \n \n12.

What is New: Improving the Methodology After the Second Round of Data Collection. B-READY \naims to balance two core objectives: (1) maintaining the relevance of the methodology by updating it as \nnecessary, and (2) preserving comparability over time by reviewing the methodology only at regular \nintervals once every three -year cycle. During t he first three- year cycle of the B -READY project, \ngeographical coverage is expanded, and methodology is refined annually. Throughout this phase, t he \nimplementation of data collection and feedback from experts and users may uncover practical challenges, \ninconsistencies, or other methodological issues that become evident only after data collection and analysis. \nConsequently, m ethodological improvements are made to enhance the accuracy, efficiency , and \neffectiveness of the methodology. \n \nThe Business Ready Methodology Handbook reflects the methodological refinements, with a new edition \naccompanying each report in the first three-year cycle. The First Edition was originally published in May \n2023. After completing the first round of data collection in 2024, the methodology for each topic was \nreviewed and updated as needed. Changes incorporated in the B-READY 2024 report were reflected in the \nupdated First Edition of the Methodology Handbook, which was published at the same time as the 2024 \nreport. The Second E dition of the Handbook, prepared for the B -READY 2025 report, was published in \nOctober 2024. Following the completion of the second round of data collection in 2025, the methodology \nfor each topic was again reviewed and refined as appropriate. Changes incorporated in the B-READY 2025 \nreport were subsequently reflected in the Second Edition of the Handbook, published concurrently with the \n2025 report. \n \nThe present Third Edition reflects the refinements that are planned to be implemented for the B-READY \n2026 report. These changes are categorized as either major or minor revisions. \n \n The major revisions implemented for the 2026 cycle include: \n\u2022 Addition or deletion of parameters or scenarios: Parameters or scenarios were added or removed to \nimprove the comparability of expert responses, increase data representativeness or for simplification \npurposes. \n\u2022 Adjustment of weight: The weight of categories or subcategories was adjusted to ensure a better \nbalance that reflects the relative importance of each category and subcategory. \n\u2022 Adjustment of structure: The structure of topics was adjusted to provide a more appropriate \ndistribution of points among pillars/indicators and better reflect the importance of good practices \nmeasured. \n\u2022 Addition of specific questions, indicators, subcategories, or categories : Certain questions, \nindicators, subcategories or categories were added to improve the quality of the questionnaires as well \nas to strengthen the assessment of the business environment in the covered economies. \n\u2022 Deletion of specific questions, indicators, subcategories, or categories: Certain elements were \nremoved due to factors such as low data variation, low informed response rate, interpretation issues, \nand redundancy. If weight was adjusted due to deletion, the change is listed under this major revision. \n\u2022 Splitting or m erging of specific questions, indicators, subcategories or categories: Questions, \nindicators, subcategories or categories were merged or split due to factors such as low data variation,"

While not exhaustive, the list \nprovides a sample of major and minor changes for each topic. \n \nBusiness Entry \nMajor revisions: In Pillar I, under Subcategory 1.1.3\u2013Simplified Registration, indicators on the availability \nof simplified registration were restructured to improve consistency. Previously, questions combined all \ncompany types and foreign entrepreneurs without clearly distinguishing between them. The revised \napproach asks about simplified registration processes and standardized forms for LLCs only, with separate \nquestions for domestic and foreign companies, creating a clearer, more parallel structure. Under Category \n1.2\u2013Restrictions on Domestic and Foreign Firms, indicators with minimal cross -country variation were \nremoved. Two questions on restrictions were refined to present different scenarios reflecting varying levels \nof restrictions rather than asking broadly whether restrictions exist, better capturing the range of barriers \ncompanies face when entering the market. In Pillar III, case study parameters were updated to include two \nnew assumptions\u2014number of shareholders and number of employees \u2014providing gr eater detail on the \nregistration process. Start-up capital assumptions were also revised: for domestic companies in low-income \nto upper-middle-income economies, start-up capital remains at five times GNI per capita, while for high -\nincome economies, it is now capped at USD 13,936 (the World Bank\u2019s income threshold for high-income \nclassification for fiscal year 2026) to ensure assumptions remain representative of typical new businesses. \nFor foreign companies, start-up capital is now set at a fixed amount of USD 500,000 across all economies, \nindependent of the recipient\u2019s economy income level. \n \nMinor revisions: The questionnaire structure was reorganized to improve user experience. Previously, Pillar \nI (legal framework) and Pillar II (public services) questions were separated by type. Now, questions are \ngrouped thematically \u2014 for example, asking whether company name registration is legally required, \nfollowed immediately by whether company names can be searched online. This pattern is applied \nconsistently across registration-related topics. In Pillars I and II, several subcategory and indicator names \nwere updated, and various questions were rephrased to improve clarity and readability. For example, in \nPillar II, under Subcategory 2.1.2\u2013Storage of Company and Beneficial Ownership Information, questions \non business registry platforms were simplified. Previously, a single question asked about all features a \nregistry platform should have; now, the questionnaire first asks whether a publicly accessible platform \nexists, followed by three separate questions on specific features. \n \nBusiness Location"

    "content": "Major revisions : In Pillar s I and II, new indicators and subcategories were added to capture more \ncomprehensive good practices while broadening the scope of measurement. For example, in Pillar I under \nCategory 1.1\u2013Property Transfer and Land Administration, a new Subcategory 1.1.4\u2013Property Market \nGovernance was introduced with four indicators measuring protections against arbitrary expropriations and \nlease terminations, as well as public tender requirements for state-owned immovable property transactions. \nIn Pillar II, Subcategory 2.1.3\u2013Coverage of the Land Registry and Cadaster was expanded from 2 to 5 \nindicators, separating city-level and national-level coverage metrics for both land registry and cadaster, plus \nadding a new indicator on Share of Public Land Mapped. Furthermore, in Pillars I and II, several indicators \nwere removed or consolidated due to low data variability or interpretation challenges. For example, in Pillar \nI under Subcategory 1.4.1\u2013Environmental Permits for Construction, six indicators \u2014 Q ualified \nProfessional/Professional Agency to Conduct EIA, Criteria that Trigger an EIA, EIA for Projects with Low \nEnvironmental Impact, Qualified Professional to Review EIA, Public Consultations Requirement Elements, \nand Disclosure of EIA Information \u2014 were deleted. Additionally, weights were adjusted across multiple \ncategories to better reflect data variation and relative importance of good practices measured. For instance, \nin Pillar I, Subcategory 1.2.3\u2013Zoning and Land Use Regulations increased from 5.00 to 10.00 rescaled \npoints, while Subcategory 1.2.2\u2013Building Energy Efficiency Standards decreased from 15.00 to 10.00 \nrescaled points. \n \nMinor revisions: In both Pillars I and II, several subcategories and indicators were renamed for better clarity \nand consistency. For example, in Pillar I, Subcategory 1.2.2 was renamed from \"Building Energy \nStandards\" to \"Building Energy Efficiency Standards\" to better r eflect the scope of measurement, and \nCategory 1.3 was updated from \"Absence of Restriction on Owning and Leasing Property\" to \"Absence of \nRestrictions on Owning and Leasing Property\" (plural form) for grammatical consistency. In Pillar II, \nSubcategory 2.1.2 was renamed from \"Property Transfer \u2013Digital Land Management and Identification \nSystem\" to \"Property Transfer\u2013Digital Land Management\" for clarity, and Subcategory 2.1.3 was renamed \nfrom \"Property Transfer\u2013Coverage of the Land Registry and Mapping Agency\" to \"Property Transfer \u2013\nCoverage of the Land Registry and Cadaster\" to align with standard terminology. Additionally, in Pillar III, \nunder Subcategory 3.2.2\u2013Time to Obtain a Building Permit and 3.2.3\u2013Cost to Obtain a Building Permit, \nnon-scored questions concerning certificates of compliance from utility providers and inspections \nconducted prior to permit issuance were removed. These changes sharpen the focus on the core, verifiable \nsteps of the building-permit process and streamline the questionnaire. \n \nUtility Services \nMajor Revisions: In Pillars I and II, new indicators were added to capture more advanced good practices \nwhile broadening the scope of the measurement. For example, in Pillar I under Category 1.1 \u2013Electricity, \ntwo new indicators were introduced: Regulatory Enablers for Renewable Energy Integration into the Grid \nand Regulatory Enablers for Renewable Energy Self -Generation. These additions expand the scope of \nassessments on requirements related to the environmental sustainability of electricity provision and use by \nincluding renewable energy integration. Furthermore, in Pillar s I and II, several questions and indicators \nwere removed due to low data variability. For example, in Pillar II, under the Subcategories on Digital \nServices and Interoperability \u2014 2.1.1 for Electricity, 2.2.1 for Water, and 2.3.1 for Internet \u2014 questions \nthat measure availability of online payment for electricity, water and internet bills, respectively, were \nremoved. Additionally, within Pillar s I and II, certain indicator components were divided into individual \nindicators. For instance, in Pillar I, under Category 1.1\u2013Electricity, Category 1.2\u2013Water and Category 1.3\u2013\nInternet, questions on joint construction of infrastructure and questions on timeline for approvals are now \nassessed as two separate indicators, allowing to capture distinct elements of best practices more effectively. \n \nMinor revisions: In both Pillars I and II, specific questions were rephrased to improve clarity and more \naccurately capture best practices. For example, in Pillar I, questions on the approval of tariffs under \nCategory 1.1\u2013Electricity and Category 1.2\u2013Water were updated: the reference to \u2018regulator\u2019 was changed \nto \u2018designated independent authority (e.g., regulator or other government institution)\u2019 with final decision-"

In Pillar III, within the Affordability subcategories \u2014 \n3.1.1 for Electricity, 3.2.1 for Water, and 3.3.1 for Internet \u2014 non- scored questions on cost components \nwere removed to streamline the questionnaire. These questions were initially included to provide further \ndetails when the scored questions on the cost of connection were included for the first time into the \nquestionnaires. \n \nLabor \nMajor revisions : In Pillar I, under Subcategory 1.1.1\u2013Labor Rights and Subcategory 1.2.1\u2013Terms of \nEmployment, new indicators pertaining to informality and remote work were added to recognize the \nimportance of combating informality and exploring flexibility in working arrangements. In addition, some \nindicators have been merged or disaggregated to provide better balance within subcategories. For example, \nunder Subcategory 1.1.1\u2013 Labor Rights, a single indicator, Freedom of Association and the Right to \nCollective Bargaining, now replaces the two separate indicators. In addition, two distinct indicators \u2014 \nPlatform Workers\u2019 Rights and Benefits under Subcategory 1.1.1\u2013Labor Rights and Regulation of Platform \nWorkers under Subcategory 1.2.1\u2013Terms of Employment \u2014 have replaced the previous single, general \nindicator. In Pillar II, under Subcategory 2.2.1\u2013Employment Centers and Training, a new indicator \nEmployment Platforms and Digital Skills was introduced to underscore the role of digitalization in the \neffective delivery of public services. Moreover, in line with good practice in collecting sex -disaggregated \ndata, new indicators \u2014 Sex-Disaggregated Data on Informal Employment and Sex-Disaggregated Data on \nWages \u2014 were added under Subcategory 2.2.4\u2013Labor Statistics to support the development of sound, \nevidence-based policies. \n \nMinor revisions: In Pillars I and II, some indicator names were refined to improve clarity \u2014 for example, \nby adding \u201cscheme\u201d to all social protection \u2013related questions. Furthermore, numerous questions were \nrefined to ensure clarity and precision. This includes, for example, adding t he term \u201cdirectly\u201d to specify \nthat the question refers to direct payments rather than general payments, and extending certain questions \nrelated to the enforcement of forced or child labor and Occupational Safety and Health (OSH) regulations \nto include \u201cother governmental bodies\u201d, thereby ensuring that enforcement by both labor inspectors and/or \nconstitutionally mandated authorities, such as the police, is considered. In addition, many clarifying notes \nwere revised or introduced to eliminate potential ambiguity. For example, in the question on notice period \nand severance pay, a note has been included to specify that dismissals for economic reasons are considered, \nwith further clarification of what this entails. \n \nFinancial Services \nMajor revisions : In Pillar I, the new Category 1.3 \u2013Credit Bureaus and Registries was introduced, \ncomprising Subcategories 1.3.1\u2013Legal Framework and Governance, 1.3.2\u2013Data Management, Integrity and \nProtection, 1.3.3\u2013Advanced Features, and 1.3.4\u2013Data Subject and Consumer Rights, to better reflect the \nrole of credit information regulations in modern financial ecosystems. In addition, new subcategories and \nindicators were added across Categories 1.1\u2013Commercial Lending, 1.2\u2013Secured Transactions and 1.4\u2013E-\nPayments to broaden the measurement scope and add nuanced depth, thereby enhancing the relevance and \nprecision of the assessment of the regulatory framework in these areas. For example, under Category 1.1\u2013\nCommercial Lending, two new subcategories were introduced \u2014 Subcategory 1.1.5\u2013Digital ID System and \nSubcategory 1.1.6\u2013Digital Commercial Lending. Similarly, In Pillar II, Category 2.1\u2013Commercial Lending \nand Category 2.4\u2013E-Payments were added to better align the distribution of weights between Pillars I and \nII, wh ile some categories were expanded with new subcategories and indicators to capture important \nelements of public service delivery.

For example, in \nSubcategories 1.4.1\u2013Risk Management and 1.4.2 \u2013Consumer Protection, questions relevant to bank \npayment service providers were removed to emphasize non-bank payment service providers. \n \nMinor revisions: In Pillars I, II, and III, some questions were updated to provide more clarity and nuance. \nFor example, in Pillar III, under S ubcategory 3.1.2 \u2013Operational Efficiency of Security Interest, the \nquestions on the time and cost of registering a security interest previously referred to a single collateral \nregistry in the economy. These questions have now been rephrased and split into three separate que stions \nto account for economies with multiple (up to three) relevant registries where security interests can be \nregistered. Similarly, the question on timeliness requirement, under Subcategory 3.1.3\u2013Operational \nEfficiency of Credit Data Update was rephrased to explicitly focus on the average number of calendar days \nrequired in practice for information submitted to a Credit Reporting Service Provider to be reflected in \ncredit reports, thereby reducing ambiguity about timing and operational realities. \n \nInternational Trade \nMajor revisions: The scoring structure was rearranged to enhance clarity and facilitate the interpretation of \nscores. Pillar I shifted from two categories based on the type of regulations to three categories based on the \ntype of trade covered: 1.1\u2013Trade in Goods, 1.2\u2013Trade in Transport and Logistics Services and 1.3\u2013Digital \nTrade. The subcategories were also revised, with each type of trade assessed along the same four dimensions: \nAbsence of Restrictions, Facilitating Practices, Trade Cooperation, and Sustainable Trade. For Pillar II, \nformer Category 2.1\u2013Digital and Physical Infrastructure was split into three, for a total of four categories: \n2.1\u2013Transparency of Trade Regulations, 2.2\u2013 Digitalization and Interoperability of Trade \nFacilitation Services, 2.3\u2013Infrastructure at Main Customs Border Posts, and 2.4\u2013Border Management \nServices. Additional subcategories were created to reflect the changes at the category level. For Pillar III, \nCategories 3.1 \u2013Compliance with Export Requirements and 3.2\u2013Compliance with Im port Requirements \nwere revised by adding one subcategory in each of them: 3.1.2\u2013Compliance with Export Requirements \n(Dispersion) and 3.2.2\u2013Compliance with Import Requirements (Dispersion). Accordingly, weights were \nredistributed within the new categories and subcategories across all pillars, taking into account their relative \nimportance. Major revisions were also made to the parameters. The following specific parameters were \ndeleted for improved comparability and simplification: Agricultural Product Chapter s, Manufactured \nProduct Chapters, Traded Products, and Traded Environmental Products. The specific parameter, Main \nBorder, was replaced by a new parameter named Main Customs Border Post. Finally, the general \nGeographical Location parameter was replaced by the Active Trade Flows by Transport Mode parameter. \nThe new parameters allow, inter alia, broader coverage: the indicators on trade infrastructure and freight \ntransport services are now assessed for all active transport modes and main customs border posts in each \neconomy. \n \nMinor revisions: For all Pillars, some questions were updated to provide more clarity to respondents. For \nexample, in Pillar II, the questions under Subcategory 2.2.1\u2013Electronic Trade Facilitation Services now ask \nrespondents about the possibility of completing specific formalities online rather than asking about the \nintegration of agencies in the electronic trade platforms. Further, the names of several categories, \nsubcategories, and indicators were updated to provide more clarity and align with the revised questionnaires \nand scoring structure.

In Pillar II, the names of several subcategories and \nindicators were updated to provide more clarity and align with the revised questionnai re structure. For \nexample, Subcategory 2.3.1\u2013Annual Performance and Gender Diversity in the Tax Administration was \nrenamed to Annual Performance following the removal of the indicator Gender Composition of the Staff \nin The Tax Administration. In addition, the name of Pillar III \u2013Operational Efficiency of Tax System in \nPractice was revised to Efficiency of Tax System in Practice to better reflect the scope of good practices. \n \nDispute Resolution \nMajor revisions: In Pillar I, under Subcategory 1.1.2\u2013Judicial Competence (includes gender and \nenvironment), a new indicator on establishing liability for engaging in bribery of foreign public officials \nwas added to acknowledge the critical importance of fighting corruption in the business context. In Pillar \nII, Subcategory 2.2.2\u2013Public Services for Mediation (includes gender) was supplemented with a new \nquestion on the availability of court -annexed mediation at the appellate level to reflect the high value of \noffering mediation services beyond first instance dispute resolution. With regards to Pillar III, two \nindicators under Subcategory 3.2.1\u2013Reliability of ADR were replaced to better capture the actual \nexperience of firms: the Perceptions of Arbitration Being a Reliable Mechanism to Resolve Commercial \nDisputes indicator was substituted with Use of Arbitration by Businesses, while the Perceptions of \nMediation Being a Reliable Mechanism to Resolve Commercial Disputes indicator was replaced with Use \nof Mediation by Businesses. \n \nMinor revisions: In both Pillars I and II, the wording of several questions was updated to enhance clarity \nand ensure technical accuracy. In this vein, in Pillar I, the question on the code of ethics for enforcement \nagents was modified to specify that when enforcement ag ents are part of the court personnel, a code of \nethics for nonjudicial court employees can be considered. In Pillar II, the instructions for the questions on \nthe availability of arbitration and mediation services omitted the reference to arbitration and mediation \ninstitutions to account for instances in which these services are available in practice even when such \ninstitutions have not been established. \n \nMarket Competition \nMajor revisions: In Pillar I of the Competition Law questionnaire, under Subcategory 1.1.1\u2013Antitrust, the \nindicator Consideration of Multiple Factors when Defining Market Dominance was added to assess whether \nthe regulatory framework considers factors beyond market share w hen defining market dominance. This \nexpands the scope of the subcategory to capture dominance arising from structural advantages that may not \nbe reflected in market -share measures. In Subcategory 1.1.3\u2013 State-Owned Enterprises Framework an d \nScope of Competition Law, the indicator SOEs Receive Preferential Treatment Compared to Private Firms \nwas expanded to capture preferential treatment in access to land, natural resources, public procurement, and \ntaxes or fiscal obligations. This captures other advantages embedded in policy frameworks that can distort"

In Pillar II, \nseveral questions relating to the availability of public information, under Category 2.3\u2013Public Information \non Insolvency Proceedings and Registry of Insolvency Practitioners, have been modified to specifically ask \nwhether such public information has been made available through electronic means, recognizing the \nimportance for such information to be accessible widely and electronically. In Pillar III, under Categories \n3.1\u2013Reorganization Proceedings and 3.2 \u2013Liquidation Proceedings , questions relating to time and cost \nestimates for in-court reorganization and liquidation proceedings have been split into several quest ions to \narrive at disaggregated time and cost estimates. This aims to broaden the scope of measurement and provide \nactionable inputs to policymakers by identifying specific procedural and substantive bottlenecks \ncontributing to time delays and higher costs. \n \nMinor revisions: In Pillar I, non- scored questions under Subcategory 1.1.1\u2013 Pre-Commencement and \nCommencement Standards in Liquidation and Reorganization relating to whether reorganization \nproceedings are regulated under the legal framework, and Subcategory 1.2.1\u2013 Management of Debtor\u2019s \nAssets during Liquidation and Reorganization (includes environment) relating to whether the legal \nframework provides for exceptions to stay of proceedings, were removed as they were initially included for \ntesting purposes.

Firm-level data is obtained by expanding the World Bank Enterprise Surveys ( WBES) program, \nwhich is also housed in DECIG and has conducted over 400 Enterprise Surveys more than 170 economies \nover the past two decades. The expanded World Bank Enterprise Surveys is a full-fledged WBES with B-\nREADY-specific questions integrated into the main survey module. The expansion of the WBES program \noffers substantial benefits as a global public good. First, the WBG produces B- READY data that is \ngrounded on information from the entrepreneurs themselves. Second, the WBG delivers a high-quality firm \nsurvey program at regular frequencies with global coverage, which is unique and unavailable anywhere \nelse in the world. This substantially expands the benefits that the WBG country teams (and, more broadly, \npolicymakers, development practitioners, and researchers) enjoy from having an WB ES done in their \neconomies. Third, the combination of B -READY data with rich data on firm attributes (included in the \nmain WBES questionnaire) enables more granular analysis (at both the firm and economy levels) of the \ncauses and consequences of the regulatory and public service topics c aptured by B-READY. A limitation \nto note is that the WBES includes registered firms only. Although information from informal firms can add \nvalue to measuring the business environment, extending the surveys to the informal sector would be \nprohibitively expensive. The Enterprise Analysis Unit (DECEA) is developing a method to survey informal \nfirms, known as the Informal Sector Enterprise Survey. In the future, when a cost-effective methodology is \nwell established, the B-READY team will consider collecting data from informal firms and entrepreneurs \nas well."

MOTIVATION \n \nRegistered companies benefit from a variety of advantages, including the legal and financial services \nprovided by courts and banks. Their employees enjoy social security protection. Additionally, the economy \ntakes advantage of positive spillovers: where formal entrepreneurship is high, job creation and economic \ngrowth also tend to be high. 1 A s more businesses formalize, the tax base also expands, enabling the \ngovernment to spend on productivity-enhancing areas and pursue other social and economic policy goals. \nHowever, entrepreneurs often encounter barriers to entry into the formal economy. \n \nThere is evidence that higher costs for business start-ups are associated with lower business entry and lower \nlevels of employment and productivity.2 Cumbersome regulations for business start-ups are associated with \nhigh levels of corruption and informality. 3 A simple business start- up process is conducive to formal \nentrepreneurship.4 Moreover, digital technology and transparency of information can encourage businesses \nto register and promote private sector growth. \n \nDigital public services can address the concerns of entrepreneurs by reducing the compliance cost of \ninteracting with government authorities and thus encourage business formalization.\n5 In addition, transparent \nand accurate data on registered businesses are an important building block of a good business environment \nbecause they give governments the tools to produce business statistics and design relevant policies and \nprovide market participants with the information to assess their risks and opportunities. Transparency of \nbeneficial ownership helps safeguard the integrity and reputation of the business sector by making it \nunattractive to those intent on using their corporate structures for illicit purposes. \n \nIn this context, the Business Entry topic measures quality of regulations for business entry, the provision \nof digital public services and transparency of information for business entry, and the operational efficiency \nof business entry. \n \nII. INDICATORS \n \nThe Business Entry topic measures the process of registration and start of operations of new limited liability \ncompanies (LLCs) across three different dimensions, referred to as pillars. The first pillar assesses the \nquality of regulations for business entry , covering de jure features of a regulatory framework that are \nnecessary for the adoption of good practices for business start -ups. The second pillar measures the \navailability of digital public services and transparency of information for business entry . The third pillar \nmeasures the time and cost required to register new domestic and foreign companies. Each pillar is divided \ninto categories\u2014defined by common features that inform the grouping into a particular category\u2014and each \ncategory is further divided into subcategories. Each subcategory has several indicators, each of which may, \nin turn, have several components. Relevant points are assigned to each indicator and subsequently \naggregated to obtain the number of points for each subcategory, category, and pillar. Table 1 summarizes \nall three pillars and their respective categories. \n \nTable 1.

As such, it is important to assess whether the applicable regulatory framework includes good \npractices promoting a safe and secure environment for business start-ups at the time of filing and updating \ncompany information. Good practices include the registration of company information with safety checks \nand preventive mechanisms (for example, verification of company name, verification of corporate identity, \nand/or verification of identity of entrepreneurs). In addition to compliance at the moment of incorporation, \nit is also important to make the necessary updates in the business registry when changes arise (for example, \nchanges to the company name or shareholders\u2019 information) to guarantee the good quality and reliability of \nthe registered information.\n6 Therefore, Subcategory 1.1.1\u2013Company Information Filing Requirements \ncomprises seven indicators (table 3)."

Business registries are \nincreasingly expanding and connecting such services to allow entrepreneurs to complete the whole \nincorporation process online, from submitting the application to receiving company documents in an \nelectronic format, including issuing the final incorporation certificate online.\n14 Therefore, Subcategory \n2.1.1\u2013Business Start-Up Process comprises six indicators (table 10). \n \nTable 10.

Within this context, \nthe implementation of electronic systems where company records are digitally stored contributes to a more \nefficient storage of information. It also helps relevant public agencies and shareholders access company \ninformation simultaneously throughout the entire registry system.\n15 Along with systems to store company \ninformation, economies are increasingly setting up platforms to store information on beneficial \nownership.16 Therefore, Subcategory 2.1.2\u2013Storage of Company and B eneficial Ownership Information \ncomprises three indicators (table 11). \n \nTable 11.

This includes a unified and automated \nprocess for identity verification and the availability of electronic signatures. These tools help ensure that \nthe information recorded by the registry and other public entities is reliable and make the interactions of \nbusinesses with the public sector and with other businesses more efficient.

Similarly, such information exchange streamlines the process of updating company information \nduring the life cycle of a business. Therefore, Subcategory 2.2.1\u2013Exchange of Company Information \ncomprises two indicators (table 13). \n \nTable 13. Subcategory 2.2.1\u2013Exchange of Company Information \n Indicators Components \n1 Exchange of Information Among \nPublic Sector Agencies Automatic electronic data exchange among public agencies \n2 Update of Company Information \nFully Automated Automatic updates of company information across public agencies \n \n2.2.2 Unique Business Identification \nA Unique Business Identifier (UBI) provides a single means of identifying legal entities engaged in \ndifferent business transactions and regulatory interactions.\n19 It can help public agencies share information \nmore seamlessly on the business activities occurring under their jurisdiction. For private companies, the \nUBI gives them a unique number that can be used as their identification in their legal and financial \ndocuments as well as in their contracts with other parties. Furthermore, it facilitates regulatory compliance \nin the business entry process by minimizing the burden of providing similar information to different \nagencies. Therefore, Subcategory 2.2.2\u2013Unique Business Identification comprises two indicators (table 14)."

At the same time, the easier it is to access information about \nregulations, the easier it is to comply with them.\n20 Thus, this subcategory measures whether the fees, service \nstandards, requirements, and documentation needed to incorporate and operate a company are easily \naccessible on an official website. In addition, it measures the availability of business information relevant \nfor women entrepreneurs, particularly on publicly funded programs to support women- owned small and \nmedium limited liability companies, because those represent policy solutions to reduce gender gaps in \nentrepreneurship.21 Therefore, Subcategory 2.3.1\u2013Business Incorporation (includes gender) comprises four \nindicators (table 15). \n \nTable 15.

DATA SOURCES \n \n4.1 Data Collection Sources \n \nThe data for all three pillars are collected through consultations with private sector experts. Private sector \nexperts include practitioners, lawyers, and notaries working in the business start-up process. These experts \nhave deep knowledge of the laws and regulations for company incorporation, as well as the different \nregulatory processes that new entrepreneurs need to complete before starting operations. \n \n4.2 Screening and Selection of Experts \n \nThe Business Entry topic has one questionnaire. A screener questionnaire is used to assist the selection of \nexperts receiving the Business Entry topic questionnaire based on a set of criteria (table 23). \n \nTable 23.\n Screener Questionnaire and Respondent Criteria \nRelevant Experts\u2019 Professions \nLawyers, notaries, tax advisors, accountants \nRelevant Areas of Specialization \nBusiness incorporation, corporate law, tax registration, domestic and foreign investment \nAssessment of the Experts\u2019 Knowledge or Experience Related to Business Entry and Related Regulations, Services, and \nProcesses \nKnowledge of the laws and regulations affecting business incorporation and registration; knowledge of laws and regulations on \nforeign investment; experience with submitting applications for new company registration; experience with applying for \nbusiness operational licenses; experience assisting new businesses to comply with other business start-up processes such as tax \nregistration and opening of bank account \n \nThus, t he information provided in the screener questionnaire allows the team to better understand the \nexperts\u2019 professions, areas of specialization, and experts\u2019 knowledge or experience related to the business \nentry process. \n \nIV. PARAMETERS \n \nTo ensure comparability of the data from expert consultations across economies, the Business Entry topic \nuses general and specific parameters. A parameter refers to an assumption that is made about business \nlocation (across all pillars), corporate legal form (across all pillars), and start-up capital (Pillar III only). \n \n5.1 General Parameters \nBusiness Entry employs the same general parameters in Pillars I, II, III. Many economies have subnational \njurisdictions which require a business location to be specified for experts to identify the relevant regulatory \nframework to be assessed. Similarly, many economies have different regulations depending on the \ncorporate legal form, which is also relevant for the assessment of the performance of the provision of \nbusiness entry services. \n \n5.1.1 Business Location \nJustification:"

  {
    "id": 42,
    "page": 35,
    "content": "Geographic location determines the legal requirements, the availability of services, and the time or cost to \nstart a business. For instance, geographic location determines the regulatory framework for business \nincorporation, given that legal requirements may vary at the regional level. In the case of public services, \ndigital public services availability may also differ by municipality. The efficiency, time, or cost to start a \nbusiness can be different from city to city or from region to region in practice. Thus, business location is \nan essential parameter for assessing business entry. The largest city in the economy is chosen based on the \npopulation size as detailed in the Overview chapter of this Methodology Handbook. \n \nApplication: \nFor Pillar I, the parameter is used in cases where regulations are not applicable at a national level, varying \nacross states or regions. For the economies where regulations differ across states, regulations for the largest \ncity are measured. For Pillar II, the parameter is used to determine the relevant business registry and its \navailability of business entry services. For Pillar III, the parameter is relevant for measures on time and cost \nbecause they can vary significantly across cities. \n \n5.1.2 Corporate Legal Form\u2013Most Common Type of Company with Limited Liability Company \nJustification: \nSome legal requirements and procedures needed to formally start a business are different depending on the \ncorporate legal form of the company. These can include, for instance, the requirements for the minimum \namount of paid -in capital or the registration r equirements. The same applies to the availability of public \nservices, as well as the time and cost to start a business. Thus, the corporate legal form of a company is an \nessential parameter for assessing business entry. Specifically, the Business Entry top ic looks at limited \nliability companies because they are a common corporate legal form in most economies as well as a safe \nlegal vehicle to protect the personal assets of the business owners. The most common type of limited \nliability company is determined based on information obtained from incorporation lawyers and national \nstatistical offices. The parameter applies to all pillars and indicators. \n \nApplication: \nFor Pillar I, the parameter is used in cases where regulations are different across corporate legal forms. For \nthe economies where regulations differ across corporate legal forms, regulations for the most common type \nof limited liability companies are measured. For Pillar II, the parameter is used to determine the relevant \nservices available. For Pillar III, the parameter is relevant for measures on time and cost because they can \nvary significantly across corporate legal forms. \n \n5.2 Specific Parameters \n \nParameters specific to the Business Entry topic are necessary to ensure that estimates specific to the time \nand cost of incorporation provided by experts are comparable across economies. Incorporation steps can \nchange widely depending on the size of the company. To specify the size of the company, the Business \nEntry topic employs one specific parameter on start-up capital. \n \n5.2.1 Start-up Capital (5 times GNI per capita for domestic companies; USD $500,000 for foreign \ncompanies) \nJustification: \nStart-up capital is an essential parameter for assessing the cost of business entry. Start -up capital directly \nshapes incorporation fees and other initial financial obligations. Empirical evidence indicates that capital \nrequirements influence incorporation costs in about 35% of economies, and in those cases, they represent \nnearly half of total entry costs .26 Given this empirical significance, start -up capital is included as a core \nparameter in the Efficiency Pillar."

    "content": "The Business Entry topic examines entry of an LLC with varying start-up capital levels based on company \nsize and origin. The analysis uses the following benchmarks: \n \n\u2022 Five times GNI per capita for domestic companies, except for high income economies. \nThe standard reference value for start -up capital is five times the economy\u2019s GNI per capita (GNIpc) . \nHowever, for high-income economies, the start-up capital is set at the World Bank high-income threshold, \nwhich corresponds to the income level from which an economy is classified as high-income (USD 13,936).1 \nThis ensures comparability across high-income economies. \n \n\u2022 USD $500,000 for foreign companies. \nFor foreign companies, the start-up capital is independent of the income level of the recipient economy and \nis instead set at a fixed amount of USD 500,000 for all economies. \n \nApplication: \nFor Pillar III, the parameter is relevant for measures on time and cost because they can vary significantly \ndepending on the level of start-up capital. For example, registration fees are often defined as a percentage \nof the start-up capital. Incorporation steps can also vary depending on the start-up capital of the company. \n \n5.2.2 Number of Shareholders (5 shareholders) \nJustification: \nThe number of shareholders can significantly impact the ease of business entry. Registration requirements, \nsuch as notarization, shareholder agreements, and verification procedures, typically increase with each \nadditional shareholder, affecting both time and cost. Thus, the number of shareholders is an essential \nparameter for assessing business entry. \n \nApplication: \nFor Pillar III, the parameter is relevant for measures on time and cost because they can vary significantly \ndepending on ownership structure. For example, each additional shareholder may require separate identity \nverification, notarized documents, and approval signatures. The methodology measures a scenario with five \nshareholders representing an ownership structure common among SMEs with multiple founders or \ninvestors. This applies to both domestic and foreign companies. \n \n5.2.3 Number of Employees (5 employees; 12 employees) \nJustification: \nThe number of employees affects business entry requirements, as employment -related obligations often \nscale with workforce size. Businesses crossing certain employee thresholds may trigger additional labor \nregistration obligations, mandatory social security enrollments, workplace safety compliance, or \nemployment contract formalization requirements. Thus, the number of employees is an essential parameter \nfor assessing business entry for SMEs. The two employee levels are based on empirical evidence from \nWorld Bank Enterprise Surveys. \n \nApplication: \nFor Pillar III, the parameter is relevant for measures on time and cost because employment -related \nrequirements can vary significantly depending on workforce size. The methodology measures two \nscenarios: 5 employees for domestic businesses and 12 employees for larger foreign companies. \n \n1 We use $13,936 as the cutoff because, for the 2026 fiscal year (based on 2024 GNI per capita data), the World \nBank defines high-income economies as those with GNI per capita above $13,935, with thresholds updated annually \nusing the Atlas method.

    "content": "CHAPTER 3. BUSINESS LOCATION\u2013METHODOLOGY NOTE \n \nI. MOTIVATION \n \nAcquiring the right physical location remains a cornerstone of business success for many firms, even in the \ndigital age. The selected location can influence business access to customers, transportation, labor , and \nmaterials, as well as determine taxes, regulations , and environmental commitments the business must \ncomply with. 1 Whether an entrepreneur is leasing, building or purchasing a commercial property, the \nregulatory framework and the public services related to acquiring a location can have an impact on how \nconducive the business environment is for individual firms and the private sector development of an \neconomy.\n2 Firms are more likely to invest in economies with strong property rights, where they can be \nconfident that their investment in immovable property will be safe. 3 Effective property rights \nadministration signals strong prospects for economic growth and provides confidence to the private sector \nin investing in strategic locations for businesses.4 Quality and transparency of land administration are also \nvital in reducing information asymmetries and increasing market efficiency. A reliable land administration \nsystem provides clear information on property ownership, facilitates the development of real estate markets, \nand supports security of tenure. \n \nWhen investors and entrepreneurs acquire a new location for their business, the process often involves \nlicensing requirements for altering a property or changing tenancy. Building- related permits are essential \nfor public safety, strengthening property righ ts, and contributing to capital formation. Last but not least, \ntransparent and accessible environmental regulations related to building control reduce the regulatory \nburden on firms by offering clarity on rules and regulations. \n \nIn this context, the Business Location topic measures the effectiveness of the regulatory framework, the \nquality of governance, and the transparency and operational efficiency in providing services for property \ntransfer, building, and environmental permits. The topic indicators consider both the perspective of the \nfirm/entrepreneur (firm flexibility) and the broader public (social benefits). Most of the indicators under \nthe regulatory framework pillar and the public services pillar measure both firm flexibi lity and social \nbenefits, while indicators under the operational efficiency pillar relate to firm flexibility only. \n \nII. INDICATORS \n \nThe Business Location topic measures three different options\u2014purchase, lease, or build\u2014that are available \nto entrepreneurs to choose the adequate location to set up their company, across three different dimensions, \nhere referred to as pillars. The first pillar assesses the quality of regulations pertaining to property transfer \nand construction permitting, covering de jure features of a regulatory framework that are necessary for \nimmovable property ownership and lease, as well as construction-related urban planning and environmental \nlicenses. The second pillar measures the quality of public services and transparency of information in the \nprovision of property transfer and construction permitting. The third pillar measures the operational \nefficiency of establishing a business location in practice. Each pillar is divided into categories\u2014defined by \ncommon features that inform the grouping into a particular category\u2014and each category is further divided \ninto subcategories. Each subcategory consists of several indicators, each of which may, in turn, have several \ncomponents. Relevant points are assigned to each indicator and subsequently aggregated to obtain the \nnumber of points for each subcategory, category, and pillar. Table 1 includes a summary of all three pillars \nalong with their respective categories and subcategories. \n \nTable 1. Summary Table of all Three Pillars for the Business Location Topic \nPillar I\u2013Quality of Regulations for Business Location (54 indicators) \n1.1 Property Transfer and Land Administration (17 indicators)"

PARAMETERS \n \nTo ensure comparability of the data from expert consultations across economies, the Business Location \ntopic uses general and specific parameters. A parameter refers to an assumption that is made about the \ncharacteristics of a location, the type and size of a construction project, and the value of a property. \n \n5.1 General Parameters \n \nProperty Transfer and Construction Permitting employ a common general parameter of location. Many \neconomies have subnational jurisdictions (such as the state level), which require a specific business location \nto be specified for experts to identify the relevant regulatory framework to be assessed. \n \n5.1.1 Business Location \nJustification: \nGeographic location determines the relevant regulatory framework governing construction (building and \nenvironmental) permits. In many economies, legislation governing building and environmental permits is \ndefined at city and municipal level. For property transfer and construction permits, geographical location \ndetermines which municipality, agency, or registry provides the permitting services. Some restrictions \nmight be imposed on construction and on property ownership and leasehold (both for domestic and foreign \nfirms) depending on location. Environmental clearances are also affected by the location of the property \nbeing developed. Thus, business location is an essential parameter for assessing the efficiency of choosing \na business location. The largest city is chosen based on the population size, as detailed in the Overview \nchapter of this Methodology Handbook. \n \nApplication: \nFor Pillar I, the business location parameter is used in cases where regulations are not applicable at the \nnational level but vary across states or regions. For the economies where regulations differ across states, \nregulations for the largest city (by population) are measured. For Pillar II, the parameter is used to determine \nthe relevant municipality involved in providing building permitting services and the relevant agency \ninvolved in providing environmental clearances for construction projects. For Pilla r III, this parameter \napplies to data collected through expert consultations rather than through enterprise surveys. Specifically, \nthe parameter is relevant for measures on time and cost to transfer a property, to obtain a building permit \nand an environmental permit as they can vary significantly across cities. \n \n5.2 Specific Parameters"

    "id": 120,
    "page": 88,
    "content": "Some specific parameters are also necessary to ensure that estimates provided by experts with regard s to \nthe transfer of a property, to obtaining building-related permits or environmental permits in construction, \nare comparable across economies. Obtaining such estimates can vary widely depending on the value of \nproperty (for transfer of property); type and size of building (for building permits); type and size of housing \ndevelopment (for environmental permits). \n \n5.2.1 Value of Property \nJustification: \nFor property transfer, a specific parameter of the value of property or construction cost is used to be able to \ncompute time and cost indicators. The value of the property or the construction cost is required to calculate \ntransfer tax, registration fees, and stamp duties in several jurisdictions.50 For example, in South Africa the \namount of transfer duty paid is based on the value of the property being transferred and is calculated using \na sliding scale of property tax. In Ghana, the amount of stamp duty paid is based on the value of the property \nbeing transferred and is calculated using a fixed rate. Put simply, the rationale behind setting a value of \nproperty is to ensure that related taxes and fees are comparable across all surveyed economies. \n \nApplication: \nPillar III of the Business Location topic for Property Transfer assumes the sale value of a property, that is \nreferenced in relation to applicable taxes and fees, to be 100 times the gross national income (GNI) per \ncapita. A parameter for the book value of the property is computed based on 80 times the GNI gross national \nincome (GNI) per capita. These reference values are shown as equivalent s in local currency of each \neconomy. In the absence of reliable data on property or construction values across all economies, GNI per \ncapita multiplied by 100 for sale value and by 80 for book value is suggested to approximate these values \nbased on respective affordability rates. \n \n5.2.2 Largest Municipality \nJustification: \nIn some cities, there could be one or several municipalities. The Business Location topic, and building \npermitting in particular, aim to capture the most common practice; hence, the largest municipality in the \nlargest city is considered (in terms of customers served or market share). \n \nApplication: \nThe parameter of the largest municipality in the largest city is relevant to all measures of Pillar II and Pillar \nIII for building permitting because the provision of building permits varies depending on the municipality. \nFor Pillar III, the parameter applies to measures on time and cost as efficiency of obtaining a building permit \nmay vary depending on the municipality. \n \n5.2.3 Type and Size of Building \nJustification: \nTo make the data comparable across economies for building permits, the type and size of building are used \nas a unit of measurement. The process and costs for obtaining building permits differ across economies \nbased on the type and size of the building\u2014residential, commercial, or industrial\u2014with residential projects \ntypically facing fewer requirements and lower fees. The building\u2019s size influences permit costs, inspections, \nand, in some locations, property transaction fees. Similarly, environmental permit requirements and costs \nvary according to project size, location, and environmental impact, especially regarding water quality and \nmanagement. Clear criteria for environmental clearances enhance transparency and public trust, ensuring \nthat all significant pro jects are properly reviewed to protect resources, particularly in densely populated \nareas. \n \nApplication:"

Specifically, the Building Standards \nSubcategory has 9 indicators; the Building Energy Efficiency Standards Subcategory has 2 \nindicators; and the Zoning and Land Use Regulations Subcategory has 4 indicators. Some measures \nunder this category have either a neutral or ambiguous impact on firms and hence are not scored. \n \n6.1.3 Absence of Restrictions on Owning and Leasing Property has 16 indicators with a total maximum \nscore of 16 points (16 points on firm flexibility and 0 on social benefits). Specifically, this category \nhas 4 subcategories: the Domestic Firms\u2013Ownership Subcategory has 3 indicators; the Domestic \nFirms\u2013Leasehold Subcategory has 4 indicators; the Foreign Firms\u2013Ownership Subcategory has 4 \nindicators; and the Foreign Firms \u2013Leasehold Subcategory has 5 indicators. A regulatory \nframework that imposes restrictions on le ase or ownership of property can create obstacles to \ndeveloping a business. Therefore, it is important to eliminate such barriers to promote a flexible \nenvironment for firms (firm flexibility). On the other hand, the short -term impact of such \nrestrictions on society is ambiguous (social benefits). Hence, points are only assigned to firm \nflexibility. \n \n6.1.4 Environmental Permits has 6 indicators with a total maximum score of 7 points (1 point on firm \nflexibility and 6 points on social benefits). Specifically, this category has 2 subcategories; the \nEnvironmental Permits for Construction Subcategory has 5 indicators, and the Dispute \nMechanisms for Construction-Related Environmental Permits Subcategory has 1 indicator. The \npositive impact for society is derived from enhanced environmental sustainability and improved \nadherence to environmental standards. Some measures under this category have either a neutral or \nan ambiguous impact on firms and hence are not scored. \n \nTable 38.

Specifically, the Interoperability of Services for \nProperty Transfer Subcategory has 3 indicators; and the Interoperability of Services for Building \nPermits Subcategory has 1 indicator. A regulatory framework that promotes the integration and \ncompatibility of different systems and services related land administration and building control \nservices provides for greater transparency and efficiency of services and benefits both firms (firm \nflexibility) and society (social benefits). Hence, equal points are assigned to both categories. \n6.2.3 Trans\nparency of Information has 18 indicators with a total maximum score of 36 points (18 points \non firm flexibility and 18 on social benefits). Specifically, the Immovable Property (i ncludes \ngender) Subcategory has 9 indicators ; the Building, Zoning and Land Use Subcategory has 6 \nindicators; and the Environmental Permits Subcategory has 3 indicators. A regulatory framework \nthat ensures transparency of land administration, building control and environmental permitting \nservices provides firms with clarity and predictability regarding the rules and regulations they need \nto comply with, which in turn allows them to operate with greater flexibility and adaptability. This \ncan result in increased innovation, competitiveness, and profitability for businesses, which benefit \nboth firms (firm flexibility) and society (social benefits).

It might include (but is not limited to): encumbrance \nchecking, title search (to confirm ownership) checking, obtaining authorization to transfer state-owned land, \noutstanding taxes (property or other taxes) checking, bankruptcy checking, utilities (outstanding bills) \nchecking, company profile checking, cadastral plan checking, zoning plan checking, building certificate \nfrom municipal council checking, informing the local council of sale and selling price, obtaining drainage \ncertificate from water authority, identification surveying from licensed surveyor. \n \nEasement (also referred to as servitude): A legal right for someone to use another party\u2019s land for a specific \npurpose, without owning it (for example a right of way to cross the land, or a utility easement letting water \nor electricity lines run through it). \n \nEnergy e fficiency performance standards: The incorporation of design strategies, materials, and \ntechnologies that minimize the energy consumption of a building while maintaining comfort and \nfunctionality. This can include insulation, energy- efficient windows and doors, energy- efficient HVAC \nsystems, and the use of renewable energy sources like solar panels. \n \nExpedited permitting: Process that allows a municipality to offer significant incentives for green buildings \nat little or no cost because this strategy only requires a shift in permitting priority. \n \nFire safety standards: A set of precautions and systems put in place to reduce the risk of fires and ensure \nthe safety of occupants in a building. These measures are typically required by building codes and \nregulations and may include both passive and active fire safety systems. \n \nGuarantee: This means that either the government or another authorized agency provides a legal guarantee \nthat the person listed in the title has clear and undisputed ownership rights to that property. \n \nHazard maps: O fficial maps that show areas exposed to specific hazards; they may be used to guide \nplanning decisions and to restrict or condition construction in risky areas. They include: (i) natural hazard \nmaps, prohibiting construction in zones exposed to earthquakes, floods, or similar risks; (ii) use-separation \nmaps, setting minimum buffer distances between residential areas and hazardous occupancies (e.g., \nchemical plants, fuel depots); and (iii) environmental hazard maps, protecting conservation area s, water \nbodies, or other sensitive ecosystems. \n \nImmovable property (also referred to as Real Property): Land and anything permanently attached to it. \nFor the purposes of this questionnaire, the term refers to land and buildings only. \n \nImmovable property registry: An official public inventory that documents and maintains information on \nownership of all types of immovable property, including land and buildings. \n \nInspections: The official examination and review of the various stages of building work by a designated \nauthority to ensure that the construction complies with the approved plans, building codes, and other \nregulations."

    "content": "CHAPTER 4. UTILITY SERVICES\u2013METHODOLOGY NOTE \nI. MOTIVATION \n \nBy providing essential services \u2014electricity, water, and digital connectivity\u2014utilities play an important \nrole in supporting economic and social development. Without these services, businesses cannot function, \nand households cannot lead quality lives. Yet, more than 30 percent of businesses globally identify \nelectricity supply as a major constraint to their operations, according to the World Bank Enterprise \nSurveys.1 Disruptions in electricity supply impair firm productivity, revenues, and economic growth. 2 \nSimilarly, inadequate water supply can lead to decreased firm productivity, deterioration of machinery, and \nreduced profits.3 \n \nAccess to affordable and reliable internet is another critical element in today\u2019s digitalized world, where the \nuse of digital technologies improves productivity.4 However, as of 2021, just over 15 percent of people \nglobally had fixed broadband subscriptions, and only 1.4 percent in the least developed countries. 5 The \nprovision of basic utility services should be effective, affordable, and reliable. Facilitating timely access to \nsuch services at a reasonable cost and in an environmentally sustainable manner is instrumental for \neconomic growth.6 \n \nThe effectiveness of regulatory frameworks, good governance, transparency, and operational efficiency of \nutility services are pivotal elements of a good business environment.\n7 An effective regulatory framework, \nfor example, is a fundamental steppingstone for the provision of high-quality utility services. In addition to \nregulatory effectiveness, the quality, reliability, and sustainability of these services are vital and should be \nmaintained through monitoring the quality of service supply and connection safety. 8 Interoperability \nthrough agency coordination and digitalization of utilities can also help improve the quality of public \nservices and the customer experience and reduce the environmental impact by optimizing resource use. \n \nIn this context, the Utility Services topic measures the effectiveness of regulatory frameworks, and the \nquality of governance and transparency of service delivery mechanisms, as well as the operational \nefficiency of providing electricity , water, and internet services. The measures capture firms\u2019 experiences \nwith either public or private utilities. In particular, the topic measures commercial electricity and w ater \nconnections. For the internet, the topic focuses only on high- speed fixed broadband internet connections, \ngiven more intense data usage by firms. \n \nII. INDICATORS \nThe Utility Services topic measures indicators related to the provision of service connections and the \nsubsequent service supply for three key utilities\u2014electricity, water, and internet\u2014across the three different \ndimensions, here referred to as pillars. The first pillar assesses the effectiveness of regulation pertaining to \nelectricity, water , and internet services, covering de jure features of a regulatory framework that are \nnecessary for the efficient deployment of connections, reliable service, safety, a nd environmental \nsustainability of provision and use of utility services. The second pillar measures the quality of governance \nand transparency in the provision of utility services, thus assessing the de facto provision of utility services. \nThe third pillar measures the time and cost required to obtain electricity, water, and internet connections \nand the cost of utility service (operational efficiency), as well as the reliability of utility service supply. \nEach pillar is divided into categories \u2014defined by c ommon features that inform the grouping into a \nparticular category\u2014and each category is further divided into subcategories. Each subcategory consists of \nseveral indicators, each of which may, in turn, consist of several components. Relevant points are assigned \nto each indicator and subsequently aggregated to obtain the number of points for each subcategory, \ncategory, and pillar. Table 1 summarizes all three pillars and their respective categories for the three areas \nmeasured: Electricity, Water, and Internet."

Water demand management practices include measures to \npromote the use of water -efficient appliances, including through labeling programs. 36 Enforcement and \ndeterrence mechanisms ensure compliance with these standards. Furthermore, financial incentives, such as \ntax credits or subsidized interest rates, and nonfinancial incentives, such as awareness raising initiatives, \nfacilitate adherence to water-saving practices and adoption of water -efficient technologies. 37 Further, \nbefore being discharged to surface waters or land, wastewater should be isolated and treated.

    "content": "IV. PARAMETERS \n \nTo ensure comparability of the data from expert consultations across economies, the Utility Services topic \nuses general and specific parameters . A parameter refers to an assumption about the characteristics of \nlocation, utility provider, and the specific characteristics of utility connection and service. Questionnaire \nrespondents are presented with these parameters and assumptions and asked to evaluate a standardized \nscenario that permits comparability across locales, jurisdictions, and economies. \n \n5.1 General Parameters \n \nElectricity, Water, and Internet connections employ the same general parameter. In many economies, there \nare subnational jurisdictions that require a specific business location to be specified in order for experts to \nidentify the relevant regulatory framework to be assessed. \n \n5.1.1 Business Location \nJustification: \nGeographic location determines the availability of electricity, water, and internet connections, in addition \nto the type of connections and construction required. Different locations often have distinct infrastructure \nsetups, regulatory frameworks, and resource availabilit y, which impact the process and feasibility of \nobtaining utility services. For instance, geographic location determines the type of electricity connection: \noverhead versus underground, as well as the level of voltage (connection to high-, medium- or low-voltage \nnetwork). In the case of water connections, availability of a piped network depends on the location. For the \ninternet, deployment of specific technologies and, ultimately, availability of high-speed internet also depend \non location. These factors may affect the affordability or feasibility of utility services and the time and cost \nrequired to obtain new connections. Thus, business location is an essential parameter for assessing \nefficiency of utility service provision. The largest city is chosen based on the population size as detailed in \nthe Overview chapter of this Methodology Handbook. This approach ensures that the assessment reflects \nthe most common and impactful scenarios within an economy. \n \nApplication: \nFor Pillar I, the parameter is used in cases where regulations are not applicable at a national level, varying \nacross states or regions. For the economies where regulations differ across states, regulations for the largest \ncity are measured. For Pillar II, the parameter is used to determine the relevant utility service provider and \nis important for identifying a geographical area of provision of utility services. For Pillar III, the parameter \nis used to determine the complexity of the connection process as well as the associated costs. \n \n5.2 Specific Parameters \n \nUtility Services employs eight specific parameters. Many economies have multiple utility providers , and \nthe assessment of the performance of utility service provision requires identifying the relevant provider. \nTherefore, to ensure accurate and relevant assessments, it is essential to establish consistent parameters \nacross service providers. Utility-specific parameters are also necessary to ensure that estimates specific to \nthe connection, such as information on the cost to obtain utility connections provided by experts, are \ncomparable across economies. Utility connections can vary widely depending on the type, usage, or size of \nthe connection. In order to specify the type of connection that the dataset intends to capture, parameters of \nload capacity, consumption of electricity and water, length of connection, pipe diameter , and \ndownload/upload speed are designed for electricity, water, and internet connections, respectively. \n \n5.2.1 Utility\u2013Largest Utility Provider \nJustification:"

    "content": "In some cities, there could be one or several utility providers. The Utility Services topic aims to capture the \nmost common practice; hence, the largest utility provider in the largest city is considered (in terms of \ncustomers served or market share). In the case of internet connections, amid a competitive market of Internet \nService Providers (ISPs), the largest ISP (in terms of market share in the largest city) that offers high-speed \nfixed broadband packages (minimum of 10 Mbps [Megabits per second] downlo ad speed) is selected, as \ntheir pricing and service levels set the benchmark for the industry. \n \nApplication: \nThe parameter of the largest utility provider in the largest city is specified directly in the respective \nquestions under Pillar II. Questions under Pillar II of electricity questionnaire account for the cases of \nvertical unbundling, thus the largest utility provider is specified as largest distribution utility for questions \npertaining to connection process and as a largest electricity supplier for questions pertaining to the end-user \nsupply. Pillar III applies this parameter to assess how the largest provi der\u2019s pricing and operational \nefficiency impact businesses. For the internet , different packages are typically offered by ISPs. These \npackages vary in terms of download speed and costs, and this variation can significantly affect a business\u2019s \noperation. This is why it is crucial to set the largest utility provider as a parameter, as it directly influences \nthe availability, affordability, and quality of internet services accessible to businesses. \n \n5.2.2 Electricity\u2013Load capacity \nJustification: \nFor electricity, a specific parameter of load capacity is used for cost indicators. The load capacity is used \nas a unit of measurement; it determines how much power is used and where it is used. This information is \nimportant for electricity providers and power suppliers to set electricity tariffs. In addition, load capacity \nimpacts affordability of electrical connection and work completion timeframes. For example, depending on \na load capacity, an electrical contractor would be able to estimate whether a transformer is needed or not , \nas well as the type of a transformer, if required. Installation or construction of a transformer is one of the \ncostliest investments. In addition, the rationale behind setting a fixed load capacity ensures data \ncomparability across all surveyed economies. The Utility Services topic assumes two scenarios of the load \ncapacity i) a larger electricity connection of 180 kVA and ii) a smaller electricity connection of 60 kVA. \n \nApplication: \n- 180 kVA load capacity: The load capacity of 180 kVA corresponds to connections of the firms that \nrely on electricity for production and business operations and use electricity more intensively than \nthe basic level. For example, an average industry -specific facility (such as a co ld storage \nwarehouse) uses up to four times more electricity than a conventional business office.\n77 Some of \nthe examples of businesses with a capacity of around 180 kVA include commercial (industry-\nspecific) buildings with an average capacity of 177 kVA; small retail malls with 181 kVA capacity \nload; or indoor agribusiness facilities with 181 kVA.78 \n \nAn illustrative breakdown of 180 kVA capacity is as follows:79 \n\u2022 Lighting (30 kW [kilo watts])\u2013accounts for at least 15% of the total energy consumption \nin commercial buildings \n\u2022 PCs and data servers (10 kW) \n\u2022 Security systems (10 kW) \n\u2022 Heating/cooling (HVAC systems)\u20132 tons AC (20 kW) \n\u2022 Industry-specific equipment (example: 10 refrigerators/10 freezers) (80 kW) \n\u2022 An additional 30 kw is needed for power upgrades \n \n- 60 kVA: The load capacity of 60 kVA corresponds to connections of the firms that operate in \nsectors that require moderate but consistent power usage. The subscribed capacity of 60 kVA can"

Electricity consumption reflects the intensity of a firm\u2019s reliance on \nelectricity and is required to calculate the applicable tariff. The Utility Services topic assumes the electricity \nmonthly consumption of 34,560 kWh. \n \nApplication: \n- T 34,560 kWh: Electricity consumption is correlated with load capacity. For the warehouse with \nthe subscribed capacity of 180 kVA that operates 8 hours a day for 30 days a month, with equipment \nutilized at 80% of capacity on average, with a power factor of 1 (1 kVA = 1 kW), the monthly \nenergy consumption will be 34,560 kWh, and the hourly consumption 144 kWh (34,560 kWh/30 \ndays/8 hours). \n \n5.2.4 Electricity\u2013Length of Connection \nJustification: \nDistance to the distribution line determines material and labor cost. Utility fee schedules may also \ndifferentiate lengths to the source. The cost of materials and labor may constitute a significant share of \nconnection cost; therefore, the distance cannot be regarded as insignificant. The Utility Services topic \nassumes two scenarios of the distance to the distribution main : i) for a larger electricity connection of 75 \nmeters and ii) for a simpler electricity connection of 10 meters. \n \nApplication: \n- 75 meters: The length of 75 meters corresponds to the more complex connection case, wherein the \nlocation of the premises of the company would require extending the cables from the electricity \ndistribution main. For example, in more rural or less developed districts of the city , the spacing \nbetween poles can reach 75 meters or more, depending on the terrain and infrastructure needs. The \ndistance of 75 meters is informed by the data from the Subnational B-Ready project, that covered \nsix economies and 40 cities. In 38% of these cities, experts reported that the most common distance \nfrom the main distribution line to the connection falls within the 51-99 meter range, making it the \nmost prevalent range. \n- 10 meters: The connection length of 10 meters corresponds to the simplest connection case. For \nexample, a commercial district within the city wherein the network is well developed and the \nconnection points are readily available within the short distance, assumed to be 10 meters. \n \n5.2.5 Water\u2013Pipe Diameter \nJustification: \nThe pipe diameter directly affects water connection costs, as larger diameter pipes lead to increased material \nand installation expenses due to their size and complexity. To standardize the comparison of water \nconnection costs across economies, the assessment uses two scenarios for pipe diameters: i) 1/2 inch (21 \nmm) and ii) 1 inch (33 mm). This distinction effectively captures the typical variations in water demand \nand usage based on enterprise size, ensuring a relevant and comparable evaluation of connection costs. \n \nApplication: \nFor new connections, the 1/2-inch (21 mm) diameter pipe is applicable to smaller businesses with lower \nwater needs, while the 1- inch (33 mm) diameter pipe suits medium- sized businesses. These diameter"

    "content": "parameters correspond to globally standardized small service connections, which are typically offered by \nwater utilities for small or medium-sized businesses. Since these connection sizes are commonly available \nin all economies, information about their costs is often transparently available online, increasing the \nlikelihood that experts can provide accurate responses. In contrast, larger service connections may require \nclients to request custom quotes from the water utility. \n \n5.2.6 Water\u2013Distance from Water Mains \nJustification: \nThe distance from the water mains affects connection costs as greater distances require materials and labor \nto extend the pipe network or develop additional infrastructure, leading to higher installation expenses. \nConversely, shorter distances typically involve lower costs due to reduced material needs and simpler \ninstallation processes. The parameter of 5 meters from the water mains was chosen to standardize \nconnection costs, providing a uniform basis for evaluating connection expenses. \n \nApplication: \nThe 5-meter distance from the water mains is applied to assess connection costs for businesses where the \nproximity to existing infrastructure is relatively short and straightforward. This standard distance is used to \nrepresent typical urban settings, facil itating a consistent and comparable assessment of costs for new \ncommercial water connections across different regions and economies. \n \n5.2.7 Water\u2013Consumption \nJustification: \nWater consumption levels impact service costs through tiered tariff structures, where more intense usage \noften results in higher rates per unit of consumption. To enable comparison of service costs across \neconomies, two scenarios for monthly consumption levels are chosen: i) 20 cubic meters, and ii) 1,000 \ncubic meters. These levels cover a range of water usage from low to medium, ensuring a comprehensive \nassessment of ongoing service expenses. \n \nApplication: \nThe two scenarios for monthly water consumption \u2013 1,000 cubic meters and 20 cubic meters \u2013 are used to \nassess the impact of varying water usage levels on service costs. The 1,000 cubic meters scenario typically \nrepresents water consumption levels associated with medium -sized commercial operations . Under \nincreasing block tariff (IBT) structures, such consumption levels might fall into higher tariff blocks, leading \nto increased service expenses. In contrast, the 20 cubic meters scenario represents lower consumption more \ncommon in smaller businesses or facilities, typically resulting in lower tariff rates and reduced service costs. \nThese scenarios facilitate a comprehensive analysis of how different usage levels influence overall service \nexpenses and provide a representative overview for most business needs. \n \n5.2.8 Internet\u2013Speed \nJustification: \nInternet connections are usually categorized and priced based on the data usage and speed requirements. \nTypically, firms have higher data usage and internet speed requirements than households. For example, a \ncall center with more than 10 employees uploading and downloading data simultaneously may require a \nspeed at least 12 times faster than a small physical commercial establishment with 3 to 5 employees. \n \nA minimum of 10 Mbps is usually required by firms that have medium data usage requirements, such as \nthose that operate in the education, e-commerce, construction, or basic manufacturing sectors.\n81 In this \nregard, for the cost of connection questions, the Utility Services topic focuses on businesses with medium \ninternet data use. For example, a business with 5 employees that email, exchange files, use cloud- based \nsoftware (for inventory management, financial accounting , and paying taxes and payroll), and \nvideoconference simultaneously. Such a business could have 10 devices (PCs, tablets, TVs) connected"

This regulatory approach is often used to promote \ncompetition, particularly in markets where there is a dominant player. \n \nBackbone/Backhaul infrastructure: The wholesale portions of the telecommunications network that \ncomprise respectively, the core network and the intermediate links (or middle mile) and that are used by \ninternet service provider subnetworks to connect to the internet. \n \nCloud-based DDoS protection: A commercial cybersecurity service that is an alternative to on-premises \ncybersecurity meant to mitigate or avoid distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks on network \ninfrastructure. \n \nCommercial cryptographic method or provider : A cryptographic algorithm, standard, or solution \ndeveloped and used for commercial purposes, as well as the service provider offering its implementation. \nThis excludes cryptography designed exclusively for military or state-security applications. \n \nCOP (Coefficient of Performance) : The Coefficient of Performance (COP) is a measure of the \nefficiency of a heating or cooling system, such as a heat pump or air conditioner. It is defined as the ratio \nof useful heating or cooling output (in watts) to the amount of electrical energy input (in watts). A higher \nCOP indicates a more efficient system. For instance, a COP of 3 means that for every unit of energy \nconsumed, the system produces three units of heating or cooling. \n \nCost to obtain new electricity connection: The cost to obtain a new electricity connection includes all \ncosts incurred by the firm associated with connecting to an electrical grid, including application fees, \npermitting, inspection fees, and cost of works, labor and equipment required to connect to the grid. Do \nnot include in this value the cost of materials and equipment installed internally at the premises (for \nexample, wiring cables inside the building). \n \nCost to obtain new internet connection : The total cost borne by firm for the provision of new high-\nspeed internet connection, including application fee, infrastructure surcharges, installation costs, labor \nand equipment required to connect the establishment to the internet through a fixed connection. The cost \nof internet equipment installed inside the private property premises is excluded (such as ethernet wall \noutlet or patch panel inside the building)."

    "content": "CHAPTER 5. LABOR\u2013METHODOLOGY NOTE \n \nI. MOTIVATION \n \nLabor is arguably the most important factor of production for most businesses and the primary source of \nincome for the majority of people.1 Labor-related regulations and public services are fundamental drivers \nof private sector development from the perspective of both enterprises and workers. These regulations and \npublic services affect firms\u2019 decisions on whether to expand their workforce and whether to hire formally \nor informally.\n2 In addition, they affect the well-being of potential workers by providing them with good \njobs and opportunities for growth. \n \nLabor regulations are important for all workers. For those in formal employment, they protect workers\u2019 \nrights, reduce the risk of job loss, and support equity and welfare. For workers in the informal sector, labor \nregulations can affect their ability to transition into formal jobs.3 If labor regulations make hiring costs too \nhigh and rules too cumbersome, firms may choose to use more capital than labor or to hire informally. Such \nchoices can leave many workers behind . Sound and balanced labor regulations are needed for firms and \nworkers to benefit from a dynamic and innovative labor market that does not come at the expense of income \nsecurity or basic workers\u2019 rights.4 \n \nPublic services can help enforce and facilitate quality labor regulations.\n5 They can provide the institutional \ninfrastructure for labor inspections and audits to incentivize compliance among firms. These institutions \ncan also provide services that increase labor costs when firms are required to pay for them, such as health, \npension, or other forms of social insurance schemes. While these services address market imperfections and \nimprove labor market efficiency, their design significantly influences firm behaviour and choices. A lack \nof social security coverage for workers limits opportunities for firms, especially small and medium \nenterprises (SMEs), to transition to higher productivity and profitability. 6 Informal workers not only lack \nhealth and social protection benefits, they also face greater vulnerability and are less likely to move out of \npoverty.7 For example, in economies where essential health care is universal (or close to universal), firms \ncan benefit directly. With reduced need to provide health coverage, they can redirect resources into business \ndevelopment and higher wages. Employment services, including job search assistance and training \nprograms serve as a bridge between the needs of firms and the skills of workers. \n \nII. INDICATORS \n \nThe Labor topic measures good practices in employment regulations and public services from the \nperspective of both enterprises and employees across three different dimensions, here referred to as pillars. \nThe first pillar assesses the quality of labor regu lations pertaining to both workers' conditions and \nemployment restrictions and costs, covering de jure features of the regulatory framework that are necessary \nfor a well -functioning labor market , providing employers and employees with clearly defined rights, \nobligations and protections. The second pillar measures the adequacy of public services for labor, assessing \nthe de facto provision of social protection and the employment services on which the labor market and the \nenforcement of labor regulations depend. The third pillar measures the operational efficiency of labor \nregulations and public services in practice, capturing firms\u2019 experiences by measuring the cost of providing \nsocial contributions, time and cost of dismissal, as well as the efficiency of resolving labor disputes. Each \npillar is divided into categories \u2014defined by common features that inform the grouping into a particular \ncategory\u2014and each category is further divided into subcategories. Each subcategory has several indicators, \neach of which may, in turn, have several components. Relevant points are assigned to each indicator and \nsubsequently aggregated to obtain the number of points for each subcategory, category, and pillar. Table 1 \nsummarizes all three pillars and their respective categories."

In parallel, \nthe provision of severance pay helps to cushion the financial impact of job loss , particularly due to \nredundancy.

This \nmaximum monthly minimum wage is then divided by the monthly GDP per capita (GDP per capita / 12) in LCU to \nobtain a standardized ratio. A linear function method on a scale of 0 to 100, where 0 and 100 represent the lowest and \nhighest possible scores, respectively, is then applied. The highest possible score is obtained by economies whose \nminimum wage is at 38% of GDP per capita or lower, while the lowest possible score is obtained by economies whose \nminimum wage falls at the 95 th percentile of the collected data or higher . This approach provides a standardized \nmethod to evaluate and compare minimum wage levels in relation to economic output per capita across different \neconomies. The lower-bound threshold of 38% was derived by converting a 50% minimum- to-median wage ratio\u2014\nbased on academic consul tations which identified ratios above this level as excessive \u2014into an equivalent minimum \nwage-to-GDP per capita ratio. This conversion was conducted using cross -country data on minimum and median \nwages from 2005 onward. A linear regression model was employed to estimate the relationship between the minimum-\nto-median wage ratio and the minimum wage -to-GDP ratio, with outliers identified and excluded using the \ninterquartile range (IQR) method. The resulting estimate was 37.9786%, which was rounded to 38% for ease of \ninterpretation and application. \nNote: CBA = Collective Bargaining Agreement. \n1.2.3 Termination of Employment \nTo lessen the adverse effects of sudden job termination, it is advisable for workers to be given a reasonable \nnotice period.49 The aim of providing such notice is to prepare the worker for unemployment, allowing \nthem adequate time to adapt and find new employment. Likewise, the presence of severance payment helps \nmitigate the income loss experienced by workers in cases of redundancy . However, when the duration of \nthe notice period is too long and the amount of severance mandated by law is excessive, they no longer \nserve the purpose they were intended for\u2014to protect regular workers\u2014and instead protect a selected few. \nHight dismissal costs appear to be a contributing factor to the development of dual labor markets , reduce \nemployment among youths and prime-age women and may have adverse effects on the poor in developing \ncountries.50 Faced with costly dismissal procedures, firms may choose not to make new hiring decisions, \nwhich may, in turn, affect their productivity and growth, but also youth employment and the economy\u2019s \nhuman capital. \n \nFirms need flexibility to manage their workforce and respond to changes in the business environment. An \neconomy that requires clear and valid grounds for individual dismissal, including business needs, provides \ncompanies with the ability to quickly adjust workforce in response to changes in demand, market \nconditions, or other factors.51 Therefore, Subcategory 1.2.3\u2013Termination of Employment comprises three \nindicators (table 8). \n \nTable 8.

However, most social security schemes worldwide are founded on the principle \nof \u201csolidarity in funding\u201d. The ILO recommends a fair division of contributions between employers and \nworkers in contributory schemes, ensuring that workers\u2019 contributions do not exceed 50% of the total. 53 \nPublic unemployment insurance often relies on transfers from the general government budget , alongside \nworker and employer contributions. Such transfers serve important purposes, including subsidizing \ncontributions or benefits for individuals with limited contributory capacity or other vulnerable groups, and \ncushioning temporary surges in benefit expenditure during major economic shocks or other exceptional \ncircumstances beyond normal unemployment fluctuations.54 Therefore, Subcategory 2.1.1\u2013Unemployment \nInsurance comprises three indicators (table 10). \n \nTable 10.

However, closing the wage gap also requires attention to \nemployment quality, as there is a clear link between gender and informality: women are more likely than \nmen to work in informal employment in many countries.

Moreover, complex dismissal processes might skew the firm\u2019s labor composition toward older \nand less productive workers. Research shows that in economies with highly bureaucratic dismissal \nprocedures, firms hire fewer young workers, thus constraining youth employment.\n78 In addition, costly \ndismissal procedures pose challenges to firms.

DATA SOURCES \n \n4.1 Data Collection Sources \n \nThe data for Pillar I and Pillar II are collected through consultations with private sector experts. Private \nsector experts are lawyers with expertise in labor law and social security law practice and litigation. These \nexperts have deep knowledge of the laws and regulations on labor -related issues as well as the different \nregulatory processes that firms need to follow as they hire, employ, or dismiss workers. \n \nThe data for Pillar III are collected through Enterprise Surveys. These surveys provide representative data \non non-wage labor costs, employment restrictions and costs, and operational efficiency of public services \nas experienced by businesses in practice. A representative sample of companies captures the variation of \nexperience within each economy. Businesses with different characteristics, such as size, region, and sector, \nparticipate in the surveys. For more details on the collection of data by the Enterprise Surveys, please refer \nto the Overview chapter of this Methodology Handbook. \n \n4.2 Screening and Selection of Experts \n \nThe Labor topic has one questionnaire. A screener questionnaire is used to assist in the selection of experts \nreceiving the Labor topic questionnaire based on a set of criteria (table 24). \n \nTable 24.\n Screener Questionnaire and Respondent Criteria \n Relevant Experts\u2019 Professions \nPrivate sector lawyers \nRelevant Areas of Specialization \nLabor law, employment law, labor litigation, labor inspections, social security law \nAssessment of the Experts\u2019 Knowledge and Experience Related to Labor and Social Security Law, and Practice \nKnowledge of and experience in drafting and reviewing employment contracts; advising on compliance with labor standards \n(including wages, working time, occupational safety and health, anti -discrimination, and harassment policies); representing \nemployers and employees in disputes (such as wrongful termination, wage and overtime claims, breach of contract, and \ndiscrimination cases); providing guidance on calculating and paying social security contributions; assisting with access to s ocial \nbenefits (e.g., unemployment insurance, retirement pensions); and resolving related disputes \n \nThus, the information provided in the screener questionnaire allows the team to better understand the \nexperts\u2019 professions, areas of specialization , and experts\u2019 knowledge or experience related to labor \nregulations and public services for labor. \n \nIV. PARAMETERS \n \nTo ensure comparability of the data from expert consultations across economies, the Labor topic uses \nspecific parameters. A parameter refers to an assumption that is made about the business location (Pillar I \nand II only), type of worker (Pillar I and II only), and firm characteristics (Pillar I and II only). Questionnaire \nrespondents are presented with these parameters and asked to evaluate a standardized scenario that permits \ncomparability across jurisdictions and economies. \n \n5.1 General Parameters \n \nThe Labor topic does not employ general parameters that are applicable to all pillars."

    "content": "5.2 Specific Parameters \n \nLabor employs three specific parameters. Many economies have subnational jurisdictions, which require a \nbusiness location to be specified in order for experts to identify the relevant regulatory framework to be \nassessed. Similarly, defining the type of worker and the firm's characteristics allows respondents to \ndetermine which labor law is applicable for a certain contractual agreement or business sector respectively. \n \n5.2.1 Business Location \nJustification: \nThe business location determines the applicable law pertaining to firms and workers, in addition to the \navailability and effectiveness of public services. For instance, labor laws sometimes differ within an \neconomy or a region and are not necessarily integrated into a single national law. Similarly, public services \nmay vary depending on the location, and accessibility can be subject to geographical elements. These \nfactors may affect the way in which businesses and workers interact. Thus, business location is an essential \nparameter for measuring the adequacy of labor law. The largest city is chosen based on the population size, \nas detailed in the Overview chapter of this Methodology Handbook. \n \nApplication: \nFor Pillar I, the parameter is used in cases where regulations are not applicable at a national level, varying \nacross states or regions. For the economies where regulations differ across states, regulations for the largest \ncity are measured. For Pillar II, the parameter is used to determine the regulation that applies to these \nservices and is important for identifying a geographical area for the provision of public services. \n \n5.2.2 Type of Worker \nJustification: \nGiven the large variety of possible contractual arrangements between firms and workers, and the different \nsectors to which local labor law is applicable, the type of worker is defined as a permanent employee of \nworking age (over 25 years old), engaged in a formal employment relationship in a private sector firm. The \nworker is a national of the economy and works in the services sector, unless otherwise indicated in the \nquestionnaire for certain specific indicators, such as minimum wage. The worker may be male, female, or \nnon-binary and is hence, referred to by the pronouns he/she/they. This worker is chosen based on the \nstandard application of the labor code. \n \nApplication: \nThe type of worker is relevant to all measures of Pillar I and II because the quality of labor regulations and \nthe provision of public services varies depending on the type of worker. The parameter does not apply to \nthe subcategory of Minimum Working Age, where law provisions targeting child labor are measured. \n \n5.2.3 Firm Characteristics \nJustification: \nFirms can be classified by size or sector in which they operate. The classification of a firm determines its \ninteraction with applicable law s, as many economies have different regulations depending on the firm\u2019s \ncharacteristics. The incumbent firm is defined as a registered private sector firm with fewer than 250 \nemployees in the services industry, unless otherwise indicated in the questionnaire for certain specific \nindicators, such as the minimum wage. This size is chosen because small and medium enterprises (SMEs) \naccount for a great portion of businesses worldwide, as well as a significant portion of employment and \nGDP in emerging economies. \n \nApplication:"

The scoring for each category under this pillar is as follows: \n \n6.1.1 Workers\u2019 Conditions has 18 indicators with a total maximum score of 18 points (0 points on firm \nflexibility and 18 on social benefits). Specifically, the Labor Rights Subcategory has 11 indicators; \nthe Minimum Wage Attributes Subcategory has 4 indicators; and the Dismissal Protections \nSubcategory has another 3 indicators. A regulatory framework that follows good practices around \nworkers\u2019 conditions benefits workers and society (social benefits). Firm flexibility points are not \napplicable in this category. \n \n6.1.2 Employment Restrictions and Costs has 10 indicators with a total maximum score of 12 points (10 \npoints on firm flexibility and 2 on social benefits). Specifically, t he Terms of Employment \nSubcategory has 6 indicators; the Minimum Wage Rate Subcategory has 1 indicator; and the \nTermination of Employment Subcategory has 3 indicators. A regulatory framework that follows \ngood practices for employment restrictions and costs benefits firms (firm flexibility) and marginally \nsociety (social benefits). Hence, points are not equally assigned to both categories. \n \nTable 26.

Specifically, the Unemployment Insurance Subcategory \nhas 3 indicators, the Health Care Subcategory has 3 indicators , and the Retirement Pension \nSubcategory has 3 indicators.

Specifically, the Employment Centers and Training \nSubcategory has 4 indicators; the Alternative Labor Dispute Resolution Mechanisms Subcategory \nhas 3 indicators; the Labor Inspectorate Subcategory has 3 indicators and Labor Statistics has 4 \nindicators. Under this category, the Alternative Labor Dispute Resolution Mechanisms and Labor \nStatistics indicators have equally assigned points for firm flexibility and social benefits . This is \nbecause effective alternative labor dispute resolution and data for an inform and effective decision-\nmaking process benefit both workers and firms. Employment centers and training programs benefit \nfirms and society almost equally, so the scores are assigned accordingly. Labor inspectorates, \nhowever, benefit workers more significantly, so under this subcategory, more points are assigned \nto social benefits. \n \nTable 27.

    "content": "ANNEX B. LABOR\u2013ANNOTATED QUESTIONNAIRE \n \nAnnex B consists of a Glossary and Annotated Questionnaire for Labor. The Annotated Questionnaire provides \nthe mapping between each indicator and the corresponding question(s). \n \nGlossary \n \nAnnual leave: A period during which a worker takes time off from work while continuing to receive income \nand social protection. Annual leave is designed to allow workers to rest, recuperate, and attend to personal \nmatters. \n \nAlternative dispute resolution (ADR) mechanisms: Procedures or methods used to resolve conflicts or \ndisputes outside of traditional litigation in courts with the help of an impartial third party. These mechanisms \nare usually less formal, faster, more adaptable, and less costly. ADR procedures empower par ties to actively \nparticipate in developing solutions, promoting a sense of autonomy and control.

This maximum \nmonthly minimum wage is then divided by the monthly GDP per capita (GDP per capita / 12) in LCU to obtain a \nstandardized ratio. A linear function method on a scale of 0 to 100, where 0 and 100 represent the lowest and highest \npossible scores, respectively, is then applied. The highest possible score is obtained by economies whose minimum wage \nis at 38% of GDP per capita or lower, while the lowest possible score is obtained by economies whose minimum wage \nfalls at the 95th percentile of the collected data or higher. This approach provides a standardized method to evaluate and \ncompare minimum wage levels in relation to economic output per capita across different economies. The lower-bound \nthreshold of 38% was derived by converting a 50% minimum -to-median wage ratio\u2014based on academic consul tations \nwhich identified ratios above this level as excessive \u2014into an equivalent minimum wage -to-GDP per capita ratio. This \nconversion was conducted using cross -country data on minimum and median wages from 2005 onward. A linear \nregression model was employed to estimate the relationship between the minimum -to-median wage ratio and the \nminimum wage -to-GDP ratio, with outliers identified and excluded using the interquartile range (IQR) method. The \nresulting estimate was 37.9786%, which was rounded to 38% for ease of interpretation and application. \n \nFor length of notice period and amount of severance pay the score is calculated using the Normal Cumulative Density \nFunction (CDF) transformation method on a scale of 0 to 100, where 0 and 100 represent the lowest and highest possible \nscores, respectively.

    "content": "CHAPTER 6. FINANCIAL SERVICES\u2013METHODOLOGY NOTE \nI. MOTIVATION \n \nAccess to finance remains a major constraint for firms worldwide, despite being essential for their \noperations and expansion and positively associated with firm innovation.1 Access to finance affects firms\u2019 \nability to manage volatile cash flow and directly contributes to a firm\u2019s resilience, which was underscored \nduring the global pandemic. 2 Research has also shown that private sector financing in developing \neconomies has positive macroeconomic effects as firm -level employment often benefits from improved \naccess to finance.3 \n \nHaving a sound and robust regulatory framework that can support financial service providers and enhance \ninformation sharing can increase the likelihood of firms obtaining financing. Sound due diligence \nregulations spanning aspects of anti -money laundering/combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) \nand grounded in risk-based evaluations are important for macroeconomic financial stability.\n4 Furthermore, \na modern secured transactions system, where movable assets are commonly used as collateral, offers \nborrowers access to credit at affordable rates. 5 To enable financing, lenders require adequate access to \nborrowers\u2019 credit information to overcome information asymmetries. Sharing such information in the form \nof credit reporting reduces lenders\u2019 uncertainty about borrowers\u2019 total debt exposure, increases the \navailability of credit, and lowers interest rates.6 \n \nAccessible financing also plays an important role in maintaining a company\u2019s financial stability. Removing \nbottlenecks associated with making and receiving payments further strengthens firms\u2019 financial security. In \nrecent years, cashless transactions (including e-payments) have continued growing.\n7 However, economies\u2019 \never-increasing digitalization requires effective regulation of electronic solutions to reap the benefits of \ntechnological progress. This would enable the extensive use of electronic payments (e-payments), which is \nassociated with reduced tax evasion and lower informality in the private sector.8 \n \nIn this context, the Financial Services topic measures the quality and effectiveness of regulatory frameworks \nfor commercial lending, secured transactions, credit information systems, and e-payments. It also measures \nthe availability and quality of financial infrastructure in terms of information accessibility, interoperability, \nand level of digitalization. Lastly, the topic will also look at the operational efficiency of receiving financial \nservices from a firm\u2019s perspective. \nII. INDICATORS\n \n \nThe Financial Services topic measures four areas\u2014Commercial Lending; Secured Transactions; Credit \nInformation; and E-Payments\u2014across the three different dimensions, here referred to as pillars. The first \npillar assesses the effectiveness of regulation pertaining to commercial lending, secured transactions, credit \ninformation reporting, and e- payments, covering de jure features of a regulatory framework. The second \npillar measures the access to financial infrastructure by examining the enabling infrastructure for \ncommercial lending, the effectiveness of collateral registries, evaluating the operation of credit bureaus and \nregistries, and then the system supporting e -payments. Thus, the second pillar measures the de facto and \nsome de jure provision of financial services. The third pillar measures the operational efficiency of \nobtaining a loan, registering a security interest, sharing credit information, and operational efficiency of e-\npayments along with their usage. Each pillar is divided into categories\u2014defined by common features that \ninform the grouping into a particular category\u2014and each category is further divided into subcategories. \nEach subcategory has several indicators, each of which may, in turn, have several components. Relevant \npoints are assigned to each indicator and subsequently aggregated to obtain the number of points for each \nsubcategory, category, and pillar. Table 1 summarizes all three pillars and their respective categories for \nthe four areas measured: Commercial Lending, Secured Transactions, Credit Information, and E-Payments."

When proper safeguards \nare applied, remote customer onboarding can be considered standar d or lower risk. 17 By leveraging such \ndigital tools, financial institutions can streamline CDD while maintaining the integrity of AML/CFT \ncontrols. At the same time, these processes must ensure secure data retention and robust privacy protections, \nin line with data protection regulations, balancing AML/CFT record- keeping requirements with privacy \nprinciples to safeguard customer information and mainta in trust.\n18 Therefore, Subcategory 1.1.3\u2013e-KYC \ncomprises three indicators (table 5). \n \nTable 5.

Having an integrated and functional approach to secured transactions provides \nflexible contractual arrangements for security purposes that allows borrowers to use as much of their \nmovable assets as collateral to get credit.\n26 It also allows both incorporated and unincorporated entities to \ncreate or acquire collateral in movable assets without conferring special advantages or rights to any class \nof debtor or creditor.27 This approach helps avoid multiplicity of legal frameworks that can create gaps and \ninconsistencies. Furthermore, it can lower the risk of lending and contribute to a more stable financial \nenvironment.

Having rules that enable firms and \nindividuals to use various types of movable assets when obtaining loan gives them the ability of translating \nthe full value of those assets into productive use, by potentially increasing the amount of credit available to \nthem and reducing the cost of such credit. Use of these movable assets as collateral is generally expected \nto occur without significant legal or practical restrictions, aside from narrowly defined policy- based \nexemptions.\n28 Also, including all types of movable assets under the same regime and permitting grantors \nto describe such assets in generic terms enables parties to avoid expensive investigation at the time a \nsecurity right is created or costly litigation thereafter about whether any particular type of asset is, or is not, \ncovered by the regime. This contributes not only to firm flexibility but also to the overall benefit of society \nby promoting safe and secure lending to the private sector.29 Therefore, Subcategory 1.2.2\u2013Securing Single \nCategories of Assets comprises four indicators (table 10). \n \nTable 10. Subcategory 1.2.2\u2013Securing Single Categories of Assets \n Indicators Components \n1 Accounts Receivable \ni) Use of accounts receivable as collateral \nii) No significant restrictions on creation of security interest over accounts \nreceivable \niii) General description of accounts receivable \n2 Inventory \ni) Use of inventory as a collateral \nii) No significant restrictions on creation of security interest over inventory \niii) General description of inventory \n3 Tangible Movables \ni) Use of tangible movables as collateral \nii) No significant restrictions on creation of security interest over tangible \nmovables \niii) Description of tangible movables \n4 Intangible Movables \ni) Use of intangible movables as collateral \nii) No significant restrictions on creation of security interest over intangible \nmovables \niii) Description of intangible movables \n \n1.2.3 Securing Multiple Categories of Assets and Future Assets \nBeyond enabling security over discrete assets, a modern secured transactions system must allow debtors to \ngrant a single security right that covers several categories of assets at once and to perfect that right in a \nsingle filing.30 Allowing security over future assets ensures that the collateral base naturally expands as the \ndebtor acquires new property, without requiring repeated amendments or registrations.31 This flexibility is \ncentral to reducing transactional costs for both borrowers and lenders, who otherwise need to prepare and \nregister multiple agreements or filings. Therefore, Subcategory 1.2.3\u2013Securing Multiple Categories of \nAssets and Future Assets comprises two indicators (table 11). \n \nTable 11.

Specifying priority of registered security rights among \nthemselves as well as in relation to unregistered tax or labor claims that may arise would encourage \npredictability, enabling secured creditors to recover through enforcement outside insolvency proceedings. \nThe priority treatment accorded to buyers in the ordinary course of business 34 is another important aspect \nof the priority regime, as it determines whether movable assets can circulate freely without being \nencumbered by prior security rights .

Creditors \nmay be permitted to take possession of the collateral, dispose of it through public or private sale, or, in \ncertain circumstances, acquire the collateral through appropriation. 36 These methods of realization should \nbe subject to conditions designed to recognize the interests of the debtor and other parties with rights in the \ncollateral, including requirements related to consent, notice, or the absence of objection from the debtor or \nconcerned parties.37 Conducting any out-of-court realization in a commercially reasonable manner supports \ntransparency in the process, while the debtor\u2019s ability to redeem the collateral before its final disposition \nprovides an additional procedural safeguard.38 Therefore, Subcategory 1.2.6\u2013Out of Court Enforcement of \nSecurity Interests comprises three indicators (table 14)."

By defining clear rights and obligations, the legal framework helps build public \nconfidence in credit reporting systems and promotes equitable access to finance. A comprehensive approach \nto consumer and data subject rights includes informed consent for data usage, timely notification of data \nsubjects about the inclusion or negative reporting of their information, the right to dispute and correct \ninaccuracies, and access to external redress mechanisms when internal remedies fail. By embedding these \nsafeguards in law, credit reporting systems promote transparency, accountability, and nondiscrimination, \nthereby reinforcing consumer trust, improving data quality, and supporting the broader objectives of \nfinancial inclusion and market integrity.

They support the legal framework of security rights in movable assets by \npublicizing their existence and establishing priority among creditors based on the time of registration.72 A \ncentralized collateral registry consolidates all security interests registrations within the economy in a single \nlocation or a single database. By centralizing the collateral registry and allowing registry access to the wide \npublic, records become a vailable to all parties , enabling them to determine whether a security interest \nalready exists over a firm \u2019s or individual\u2019s movable assets. With this information, creditors can take \nmeasures to protect against any potential priority risks that may affect their prospective or existing rights.73 \nIf multiple registries exist, the rules governing third-party effectiveness and registration requirements need \nto be consistent across registries to ensure predictability for users. Therefore, Subcategory 2.2.1\u2013Registry \nScope and Coverage comprises one indicator (table 29). \n \nTa\nble 29.

A notice-based registration system for security interests \nprovides notice that the secured creditor m ay have a security righ t in the registered assets. This notice \nincludes only certain information about the security right. Thus, the security agreement creating the security \nright is not registered and its validity and content are not verified by the system or by a clerk at the registry. \nA notice-based system significantly reduces the registration burden on secured creditors and provides a \nhighly efficient and cost-effective registration and searching process. It also contributes to keeping low the \nadministrative costs of the registry.74 The process for submitting a registration notice may vary, but systems \nshould generally aim to minimize the need for manual review pre-filing so that registration can occur \nefficiently and without undue delay. At the same time, the framework should incorporate appropriate \nsafeguards, such as automated checks, attestations by submitting parties, and debtor notifications, \ncomplemented by efficient mechanisms to remove unauthorized registrations and to challenge inaccurate \nor fraudulent notices, thereby preserving the integrity of the registry while minimizing administrative \nburdens. Therefore, Subcategory 2.2.2\u2013Registry Functions and Operation comprises three indicators (table \n30). \n \nTa\nble 30.

Thus, the registry should be available online to allow direct electronic \naccess to its users. This direct client access greatly reduces operational and maintenance costs while \nenhancing the efficiency of the registration process by giving users direct control over the timing of their \nregistrations. Direct electronic access allows users to search existing registrations without relying on \nintermediaries and enables secured creditors or their representatives to perform actions related to the \nregistration notices through the system. Allowing these actions to be performed electronically streamlines \nthe registration process and reduces administrative burdens. Digital registries may also provide mechanisms \nfor addressing incorrect or fraudulent filings, enabling users to initiate challenges directly through the \nregistry interface.

PARAMETERS \n \nTo ensure comparability of the data from expert consultations across economies, the Financial Services \ntopic uses general parameters. A parameter refers to an assumption that is made about the business location \nand the type of transactions . Questionnaire respondents are presented with these parameters and \nassumptions and asked to evaluate a standardized scenario that permits comparability across locations, \njurisdictions, and economies. \n \n5.1 General Parameters \n \nFinancial Services employs two general parameters. Many economies have subnational jurisdictions, which \nrequire a business location to be specified for experts to identify the relevant regulatory framework to be \nassessed. In addition, it is important to specify the type of transactions as these are relevant for experts to \nidentify the appropriate regulations. \n \n5.1.1 Business Location \nJustification: \nGeographic location determines the regulations that govern the financial services available to firms and \nbusinesses. In addition, it is important to determine the geographical location from a practical standpoint, \nto identify experts from whom data on regulatory frameworks and practical implementations are collected."

    "content": "ANNEX B. FINANCIAL SERVICES\u2013ANNOTATED QUESTIONNAIRE \n \nAnnex B consists of a Glossary and Annotated Questionnaire s for Commercial Lending, Secured \nTransactions and Collateral Registries, Operation of Credit Bureaus and Registries, and Electronic \nPayments (e-payments). The Annotated Questionnaire s provide the mapping between each indicator and \nthe corresponding question(s). \n \nGlossary \n \nAccounts receivable: A contractual right to payment of a monetary sum arising from the supply or lease \nof goods or services, the assignment or license of intellectual property, the provision or processing of data, \nor the payment obligation for a credit card transaction. It also includes a right to payment resulting from \nthe refinancing or consolidation of such receivables. \n \nAd valorem fee: A fee for registration or filing calculated as a percentage of the value of the secured \nobligation or collateral, rather than as a fixed flat amount. \n \nAlternative data providers: Entities outside the traditional regulated financial sector that generate and can \nfurnish information relevant to assessing creditworthiness of Consumers and Firms. These include utilities, \ntelecom and internet companies, e-commerce and digital platforms, mobile money and e-wallet operators, \nBuy Now, Pay Later providers, insurers, tax authorities, and courts, among others. Their data may include \npayment histories (utilities, telecom), transactional and behavioral data (e- commerce, mobile money), \npublic records (judgments, tax arrears), and other non-loan obligations. \n \nAppropriation: An enforcement method under which the secured creditor acquires ownership of the \nencumbered asset in full or partial satisfaction of the secured obligation . Appropriation may be subject to \nsafeguards such as debtor consent and valuation. \n \nArrears: Obligations that have not been paid by their due date, meaning, an overdue payment. \n \nAssignment of receivables: A transaction functionally equivalent to a security right, under which a debtor \n(assignor) transfers its right to receive payment under an existing or future monetary claim (receivable) to \na creditor (assignee), for the purpose of securing the performance of an obligation. The creditor acquires a \nproperty right in the receivable as collateral until the secured obligation is fulfilled. Example: A \ncompany/individual assigns its accounts receivable to a lending company in return for a loan. The lending \ncompany is repaid from the receivables. \n \nBias analysis: A systematic assessment of a credit-scoring or decision-making model to identify whether \nit produces unfair, inaccurate, or systematically skewed outcomes for certain groups of Consumers and \nFirms. Bias analysis evaluates data inputs, variables, and outcomes to detect and mitigate potential \ndiscriminatory effects, ensuring that models operate fairly and consistently across comparable applicants. \n \nBuy Now, Pay Later (BNPL): Short-term consumer credit offered at the point of sale, usually online or \nin-store, that allows Consumers and Firms to purchase goods or services immediately and pay for them in \ninstallments over time, often interest- free if payments are made as agreed. BNPL providers are typically \nfintech companies or digital platforms rather than traditional banks, though some banks and card networks \nalso offer BNPL products. \n \nBusiness continuity / d isaster recovery: Policies, procedures, and technical measures established by a \nCredit Reporting Service Provider (CRSP) to ensure that its services remain available, or can be rapidly \nrestored, in the event of a disruption such as a natural disaster, system failure, or cyberattack.

Such a buyer acquires the asset free of any existing security right, even if that \nright has been properly registered or perfected.\n \n \nCollateral: Any movable asset in which a security interest is created. For the purposes of this questionnaire, \nsuch assets include accounts receivable, inventory, tangible and intangible movable assets. This \nquestionnaire excludes from its scope specialized assets , such as aircraft, ships and other waterborne \nvessels, intellectual property, securities, deposit accounts, and non-transferable public licenses or permits, \nas well as all immovable property. \n \nCollateral registry: A public database in which notices of security rights in movable assets are registered \nto render them effective (enforceable) against third parties and to establish their priority. The registry \ntypically covers all types of movable assets (except specialized assets) and extends to functional equivalents \nof security rights, such as fiduciary transfers of title, financial leases, retention-of- title sales, and \nassignments of receivables. \n \nCommercial lender: A regulated lending entity that grants loans to businesses. \n \nCommercially r easonable manner ( Out-of-court enforcement): Disposition or other enforcement \nmethods, timing, and terms that a prudent seller in the relevant market would use to obtain a fair return \nunder the circumstances. Reasonableness is judged by the process, not price alone (e.g., giving reasonable \nnotice, choosing an appropriate sale method (public or private), providing adequate market \nexposure/advertising, setting fair terms, and avoiding conflicts of interest). A low price by itself does not \nmake a sale unreasonable, but a grossly inadequate price may be evidence that the process was not \ncommercially reasonable. \n \nConsumer: A natural person who obtains or seeks to obtain credit or financial services for personal, family, \nor household purposes, and whose credit-related data may be collected, stored, and shared by a CRSP. \n \nConsumer protection: L egal, regulatory and operational measures that ensure the accuracy, fairness, \ntransparency, privacy and accountability of credit information collected, processed and disclosed about \nindividual Consumers. These measures safeguard Consumer rights in accessing, correcting, controlling and \nbeing informed about their data and how it is used in credit-reporting and credit-scoring systems. \n \nCredit bureau: Private firm or nonprofit organization that maintains a database on the creditworthiness of \nborrowers (individuals or firms) in the financial system and facilitates the exchange of credit information \namong creditors. \n \nCredit registry: Database managed by the public sector, usually by the central bank or the superintendent \nof banks that collects information on the creditworthiness of borrowers (individuals or firms) in the financial \nsystem and facilitates the exchange of credit informatio n among banks and other regulated financial \ninstitutions (while their primary objective is to assist banking supervision). \n \nCredit Reporting Service Provider (CRSP) : A private credit bureau or a public credit registry that \nprovides credit reporting services involving the collection, processing and dissemination of data for the \npurpose of facilitating credit-related decisions, financial supervision and other legitimate purposes. For the \npurposes of this questionnaire, this definition includes only core or traditional credit reporting service"

The test examines \nwhether the outcomes of the model produce significantly different results across groups, even if there is no \nexplicit intent to discriminate. \n \ne-KYC: Electronic Know Your Customer allows the bank to obtain and verify information about the \nidentity of their customer digitally, without the need for paper documents. \n \ne-KYC system: An e-KYC system (electronic Know Your Customer system) is a digital process used by \nfinancial institutions, telecom providers, government agencies, and other regulated entities to verify the \nidentity of individuals electronically. \n \ne-KYC utility: An e-KYC utility is a shared platform that enables banks and other institutions to verify \ncustomer identities through digital methods. These platforms utilize technologies such as biometrics, facial \nrecognition, and government document uploads to create a standardized, trusted source of customer data \naccessible to multiple participants. \n \nElectronic money (e-money): An electronic store of monetary value on a technical device that may be \nwidely used for making payments to other entities other than the e -money issuer. The device acts as a \nprepaid bearer instrument which does not necessarily involve bank accounts in transactions. E-money is a \nbroader category which includes specific instruments such as mobile money (e.g. M-PESA), online money \n(e.g. PayPal, Venmo) and prepaid cards. \n \nElectronic payment (e-payment): Sometimes also called a digital payment, means the transfer of value \nfrom one payment account to another using a digital device such as a mobile phone, POS (Point of Sales), \nor computer, digital channel communication such as mobile wireless data or SWIFT (Society for the \nWorldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication). This definition includes payments made with bank \ntransfers, mobile money, and payment cards including credit, debit, and prepaid cards. \n \nElectronic wallet (e-wallet): E-money product, where the record of funds is stored on a particular device, \ntypically in an IC (integrated circuit) chip on a card or mobile phone. \n \nFast payment systems: Also referred to as instant payment, real-time payment or immediate payment, is \nan infrastructure focused on clearing and/or settlement of fast payments for its participants, where it is \ndefined as a payment in which the transmission of the payment message and the availability of \u201cfinal\u201d funds \nto the payee occur in real time or near -real time or as near to a 24 -hour and seven- day (24/7) basis as \npossible. \n \nFiduciary transfer of title: A transaction functionally equivalent to a security right, under which ownership \nof an asset is transferred to the creditor for security purposes with the expectation of retransfer upon \nsatisfaction of the secured obligation. The debtor may retain possession of the tangible assets or continue \nto hold, manage, and collect intangible assets (e.g., receivables) until default . Example: A \ncompany/individual transfers the title of a machine to a bank as security for a loan and expects to retrieve \nownership of the machine following payment of the debt. \n \n \nFinancial institutions: Entities licensed or otherwise authorized to conduct core financial intermediation \nactivities, such as accepting deposits, extending credit, and managing investments.

    "content": "Financial lease: A transaction functionally equivalent to a security right, under which a lease of movable \nassets, in substance, functions as secured financing. The lessee selects the asset and supplier, while the \nlessor acquires it to lease to the lessee. The lease term typically covers most of the asset\u2019s useful life, and \ntotal lease payments equal the asset\u2019s full value plus financing charges. The lessee bears ownership-related \nrisks and costs (e.g., maintenance, insurance, taxes) and often has the option to purchase the asset at the end \nof the term for a nominal price. Example : A manufacturing company leases industrial equipment from a \nfinancial institution for nearly its full useful life. Lease payments equal the equipment purchase price plus \nfinancing charges, and the company may buy it at the end of the lease for a nominal amount. \n \nFintechs: Firms whose core business focuses on using technology to deliver financial services either solely \nor primarily online, and whose primary business is of a financial nature. \n \nFirm: A legally recognized business entity, including sole proprietorships, partnerships, cooperatives, and \ncorporations, that can obtain credit or financial services and whose credit -related data may be collected, \nstored, and shared by a CRSP. Firms are distinguished from Consumers in that the credit information relates \nto business obligations, even if the firm is owned/operated by a single person. \n \nFloating charge (Floating security right): A security right that extends to a shifting pool of assets, such \nas inventory or receivables, without requiring item-by-item identification. \n \nFunctional equivalent: A legal device or transaction that, while not creating a security right in form, \nperforms the same economic function of securing payment or performance of an obligation.

    "content": "CHAPTER 7. INTERNATIONAL TRADE\u2013METHODOLOGY NOTE \nI. MOTIVATION \nInternational trade is a key driver of economic growth and private sector development. Through fostering \ncompetition among domestic and foreign firms, it promotes specialization and resource reallocation to the \nmost productive firms. 1 While its impacts may not be uniform across firms, workers, and consumers, \ninternational trade consistently delivers broad benefits for the private sector and society as a whole.2 Among \nthese benefits is the creation of more and better jobs, with increased trade linked to employment growth \nand higher labor earnings.\n3 To remain competitive, firms must continuously adapt, innovate, and improve \ntheir efficiency, resulting in aggregate productivity growth and welfare gains. 4 Trade openness may \ngenerate further productivity improvements by creating economies of scale and providing access to cheaper \nintermediate inputs of higher quality and variety, as well as facilitating knowledge and technology \ntransfers.\n5 Increased access to foreign inputs can boost productivity and export performance, while also \ncreating opportunities for economic diversification and reducing reliance on a single product or market. \nThe complementarity between exports and imports emphasizes the importance of trade openness for reaping \nthe full benefits of international trade.6 \n \nTo fully realize the benefits of international trade, economies need a conducive business environment that \nreduces trade barriers and lowers compliance and transaction costs for firms. Firms\u2019 access to global \nmarkets depends on the quality of the regulatory frameworks in which they operate, as well as on relevant \npublic services. A regulatory framework that establishes a nondiscriminatory, transparent, predictable, and \nsafe trading environment generates incentives to engage in international trade and provides a level playing \nfield. At the same time, an effective regulatory framework also pursues legitimate public policy objectives, \nincluding protecting public health and the environment. This may result in the imposition of measures that \ncan create market distortions that impede trade.\n7 Therefore, it is crucial to have regulations that strike a \nbalance between these sometimes-competing objectives. Any restrictive regulatory requirements must be \nproportional to the pursued policy objectives and applied in a transparent and nondiscriminatory manner. \n \nIn addition, governments can provide public services to facilitate trade processes. Policies that improve the \nquality of physical and digital infrastructure, as well as border management, enable the private sector to \nmaximize benefits and minimize the burden imposed by the regulatory framework. These trade facilitation \nefforts reduce the time and cost borne by the private sector, which represents a substantial barrier to trade, \nand increase participation in international trade for small, medium, and large firms.8 By doing so, firms can \nleverage increased competition, economies of scale, and access to higher- quality inputs, to increase \nproductivity, hence benefiting the private sector as well as the broader economy. \n \nII. INDICATORS \nThe International Trade topic measures different aspects of international trade \u2014trade in goods, trade in \nservices, and digital trade\u2014across three dimensions, here referred to as pillars. The first pillar assesses the \nquality of regulatory frameworks , covering de jure features that are necessary to establish a \nnondiscriminatory, transparent, predictable, and safe environment to harness the potential of international \ntrade. The second pillar measures the digital and physical infrastructure underpinning international trade \nand the quality of border management, thus assessing the de facto supply of public services for trade \nfacilitation. The third pillar measures the time and cost to comply with import and export requirements, \nparticipation in cross-border digital trade, as well as perceived major obstacles to international trade. Each \npillar is divided into categories\u2014defined by common features that inform the grouping\u2014and each category \nis further divided into subcategories. Each subcategory consists of several indicators, each of which may, \nin turn, have several components . Relevant points are assigned to each indicator and subsequently \naggregated to obtain the number of points for each subcategory, category, and pillar. Table 1 summarizes \nall three pillars and their respective categories and subcategories for all aspects measured by the topic."

Tariffs raise trade costs for firms by increasing input \nand product prices, distorting sourcing and production decisions, and reducing productivity and \ncompetitiveness.\n9 Non-tariff measures, when restrictive or applied with limited transparency or \npredictability, can raise compliance costs and trade frictions for firms, constrain market access, and reduce \nparticipation in international trade.\n10 Therefore, Subcategory 1.1.1\u2013Absence of Restrictions (Goods) \ncomprises 2 indicators (table 3). \n \nTable 3.

Such \ncooperation matters because credible and transparent commitments open markets by cutting tariffs and \nharmonizing standards, allowing goods and services to flow more freely across borders. These reduce \npolicy uncertainty, facilitate access to larger export markets as well as access to cheaper inputs and \ntechnology, and support firms in joining global value chains and r ealizing the gains from international \nintegration.12 Therefore, Subcategory 1.1.3\u2013Trade Cooperation (Goods) comprises five indicators (table 5). \n \nTable 5.

    "content": "5.1.1 Active Trade Flows by Transport Mode \nJustification: \nDepending on its physical and political geography, an economy\u2019s trade flows may take place via maritime, \nair, or land-based routes. The regulatory frameworks and trade facilitation services differ across transport \nmodes and have direct implications for the time and cost of importing and exporting. To enable meaningful \ncomparison, it is therefore necessary to determine whether an economy has active trade flows across all \ntransport modes or only a subset of them. For example, landlocked economies do not have active trade \nflows via maritime transport, and island economies do not have active trade flows via road transport. \n \nApplication: \nThis parameter applies to all Pillars. Specifically, it determines the applicability of the transport services \nsubsectors measured in Pillars I and II , as well as the threshold pairs for assessing time and cost in the \ncategories Compliance with Export Requirements and Compliance with Import Requirements in Pillar III. \n \n5.2 Specific Parameters \n \nTrade regulations and their applicability may also vary depending on an economy\u2019s traded goods and \nservices, and the ir trading partners. To strike a balance between cross- country comparability and \neconomy\u2011specific representativeness, the International Trade topic em ploys the following specific \nparameters to provide contextual information for experts to identify the appropriate regulations to be \nassessed in different pillars. \n \n5.2.1 Services Sectors and Subsectors \nJustification: \nRegulation of trade in services varies at the subsector level. Considering the crucial role of certain service \nsectors as inputs and facilitators for international trade in goods, five subsectors across transport services \nand logistics services are selected as specific parameters for the International Trade topic: Maritime Freight \nTransport, Air Freight Transport, Road Freight Transport, Customs Brokerage, and Cargo Handling, \nStorage and Warehousing. \n \nApplication: \nThis parameter applies to indicators assessing trade in services in both Pillars I and II. Indicators measuring \nservices classified under the Customs Brokerage and Cargo Handling, Storage and Warehousing subsectors \nare applicable to all economies. However, those covering the subsectors of Maritime Freight Transport, Air \nFreight Transport, and Road Freight Transport depend on the active trade flows by transport mode (see \nsubsection 5.1.1). E conomies with active trade flows by maritime, air, and road transport modes are \nassessed on all three subsectors (Maritime Freight Transport, Air Freight Transport, and Road Freight \nTransport). Economies without active trade flows by a given transport mode are not assessed on the \ncorresponding subsector. For example, landlocked economies are not assessed on questions related to \nMaritime Freight Transport, and i sland economies are not assessed on questions related to Road Freight \nTransport. \n \n5.2.2 Main Trading Partner(s) \nJustification: \nThis parameter refers to an economy\u2019s main trading partner(s) by different trade categories. While \neconomies typically engage in trade with a wide range of partners, the intensity of these relationships varies. \nTrade intensity is influenced by factors such as geographical proximity, market size, and historical or \ninstitutional linkages. Identifying an economy\u2019s main trading partner (s) is important because c loser \ncooperation and coordination with this ( these) partner(s) can bring the most benefits to the bus iness \nenvironment.

In these contexts, main trading partners consistently refers to an economy\u2019s top three \ntrading partners in goods and services. This parameter is also used in Pillar I under Subcategory 1.2.3 \u2013\nTrade Cooperation (Services). In this context, main trading partners likewise refer to an economy\u2019s top \nthree trading partners in goods and services, except for the indicator International Road Freight Operations \nwith Main Land Border Partner Permitted without Trip-Based Permits or Quotas, where the main trading \npartner refers to the adjacent economy connected through the main customs land border post, as determined \nby the value of land-based trade flows (see subsection 5.2.3). \n \nMoreover, t his parameter is used in Pillar II under the Subcategor ies 2.4.3\u2013Coordinated Border \nManagement (with Trading Partner(s)) and 2.4.4\u2013Trusted-Trader Program.

Where such \nindicators assess a seaport or airport, the main trading partner refers to the economy\u2019s largest trading partner \nin goods only. Where they assess a land border, the main trading partner refers to the adjacent economy \nconnected through the main customs land border post, as determined by the value of land-based trade flows \n(see subsection 5.2.3). \n \n5.2.3 Main Customs Border Posts \nJustification: \nThis parameter refers to the main customs border posts by mode of transport: commercial seaport, cargo \nairport, and customs land border post. To measure trade infrastructure, it is important to identify the borders \nthat are most relevant to the economy in terms of trade value. It is also crucial to differentiate the questions \nasked by mode of transport, as facilities, services and infrastructure can vary across different types of border \nposts (for example, between a seaport and a customs land border post) . The selection of the main borders \nby mode of transport is based on total trade value, calculated from data from ancillary government sources \n(such as statistical agencies) and confirmed by experts. \n \nApplication: \nThis parameter is used in Pillar II under S ubcategories 2.3.1\u2013Infrastructure at Main Seaport, 2.3.2\u2013\nInfrastructure at Main Airport, 2.3.3\u2013Infrastructure at Main Customs Land Border Post, 2.4.2\u2013Coordinated \nBorder Management (Domestic), and 2.4.3\u2013Coordinated Border Management (with Trading Partner(s)). \n \nThe applicability of the indicators on main commercial seaport, cargo airport, and c ustoms land border \nposts is determined based on whether an economy has any operational customs border posts in each of the \nthree modes of transport at the time of the cut-off date. Economies with operational customs border posts \nin each mode of transport are assessed on questions covering all three customs border posts (seaport, airport, \ncustoms land border post). Economies without operational customs border posts in one or two modes are \nnot assessed on questions related to the corresponding customs border posts . For example, landlocked \neconomies are not assessed on questions related to seaports, and island economies are not assessed on \nquestions related to customs land border posts."

The scores on \nindicators under this pillar are assigned to firm flexibility only, as the indicators measure the time and costs \nincurred to firms as they import , export, and engage in digital trade. For example, longer clearance time \nand higher transaction costs hinder firms\u2019 ability to conduct international trade, thus hampering firm \nflexibility. The scoring for each category under this pillar is as follows: \n \n6.3.1 Compliance with Export Requirements has three indicators with a total maximum score of 30 \npoints. Specifically, the Total Time to Comply with Export Requirements (Average) Subcategory \nhas 1 indicator, the Total Time to Comply with Export Requirements (Dispersion) Subcategory has \n1 indicator and the Total Cost to Comply with Export Requirements Subcategory has 1 indicator. \n \n6.3.2 Compliance with Import Requirements has three indicators with a total maximum score of 50 \npoints.

    "content": "CHAPTER 8. TAXATION\u2013METHODOLOGY NOTE \n \nI. MOTIVATION \n \nTaxation is a powerful policy tool that governments use to generate revenues and finance operations, public \ngoods, and services. In the private sector, taxation can promote growth and development by financing \nphysical infrastructure, human capital investments, law enforcement, and other public services. On the other \nhand, excessive taxation can distort markets, alter investment decisions, and foster tax evasion.1 Likewise, \ncumbersome regulations, complex tax reporting requirements, and inefficient tax procedures may increase \ncompliance costs for firms and discourage formalization.2 Identifying the challenges taxpayers face can \nguide reforms that support private sector development while pursuing domestic resource mobilization \nobjectives. \n \nAccording to a cademic research , deficiencies such as complicated tax regulation s,\n inefficient tax \nadministration, and high tax compliance costs can affect private sector development.3 The Taxation topic \nindicators include measures that capture these potential issues, as well as measures that focus on \nenvironmental sustainability. \n \nDigitalization of tax administration services positive ly impacts tax collection.4 Electronic filing services \ncontribute to reducing compliance costs and foster a more transparent tax regime by curbing corruption and \nbribe solicitation.5 Digitalization of the tax administration\u2019s procedures also helps reduce tax evasion.6 \n \nThe efficiency of tax administration system s also impacts the burden of administrative compliance. \nResearch shows that economies with efficient tax administration procedures \u2014easily access ible \ninformation, e -tax systems, effective risk management, and transparency \u2014experience greater firm \nproductivity and economic growth.7 Impartial, accessible, and efficient tax dispute resolution mechanisms \nare essential for allowing taxpayers to challenge tax assessments and receive prompt and fair hearing.8 \nFinally, improving internal efficiency enables tax administrations to unlock additional revenues.9 \n \nIn addition to boosting economic performance, taxation can be a powerful tool in promoting environmental \nsustainability. Environmental taxes effectively address market failures in accounting for environmental \nimpacts. Carbon pricing allows consumers and businesses to choose cost-effective methods to reduce their \nenvironmental \u201cfootprint\u201d or to incentivize innovation by investing in low-carbon emissions technologies."

The first pillar assesses \nthe quality of tax regulations, covering de jure and de facto information on the legal framework. The second \npillar measures the quality of tax administration by assessing the tax-related public services. The third pillar \nmeasures the efficiency of tax regulation and related public services from a firm\u2019s perspective. Each pillar \nis divided into categories\u2014defined by common features that inform the grouping into a particular \ncategory\u2014and each category is further divided into subcategories. Each subcategory has one or several \nindicators, each of which may, in turn, consist of one or several components.

Therefore, it simplifies compliance procedures. The voluntary VAT registration for \nbusinesses that are below the threshold allow s them to participate and benefit from VAT refunds. 19 The \nVAT registration threshold allows the tax authority to concentrate its resources on bigger taxpayers, thus \nsaving budget expenditures.

However, revision of the \nenvironmental tax rates /fees might provide uncertainty. Governments can reduce uncertainty by \ncontemplating an explicit adjustment mechanism in the tax legislation and informing businesses that the \nrates/fees might be increased over time. 24 Therefore, Subcategory 1.3.1\u2013Carbon Pricing Instruments \ncomprises two indicators (table 9). \n \nTable 9.

DATA SOURCES \n \n4.1 Data Collection Sources \n \nThe data for Pillar I and Pillar II are collected through consultations with private sector experts. Private \nsector experts include tax advisors, tax consultants, tax accountants, tax lawyers, tax specialists, and tax \nauditors. The data on the time it takes to go through a tax dispute are collected through consultations with \nprivate sector experts. The reason for this approach is that firms participating in Enterprise Surveys may \nhave limited experience with processes that do not occur on a regular basis for most companies (such as \nsubmitting a tax complaint). Most data for Pillar III are collected through Enterprise Surveys. \n \nEnterprise Surveys provide representative data on the time required for filing and paying taxes, the \npercentage of firms filing and paying taxes electronically, the duration of a generic tax audit, obtaining a \nVAT refund in practice, and effective tax rates for corporate profit -based taxes, and employment-based \ntaxes and social contributions (only the financial cost for firms). A representative sample of companies \ncaptures variation of user experience within each economy. Businesses with different characteristics, such \nas size, region, and sector participate in the surveys. For more details on the collection of data by Enterprise \nSurveys, please refer to the Overview chapter of this Methodology Handbook."

    "content": "4.2 Screening and Selection of Experts \n \nThe Taxation topic has one questionnaire. A screener questionnaire is used to assist in the selection of \nexperts receiving the Taxation topic questionnaire based on a set of criteria (table 32). \n \nTable 32. Screener Questionnaire and Respondent Criteria \n Relevant Experts\u2019 Professions \nTax advisors, consultants, accountants, lawyers, specialists, auditors, associates, and analysts \nRelevant Areas of Specialization \nAccounting, tax reporting and compliance; corporate tax law; environmental tax law; indirect taxation; tax administration law ; \ntax dispute resolution; tax registration and deregistration procedures; tax review and enforcement; labor taxes and social \ncontributions \nAssessment of the Experts\u2019 Knowledge and Experience Related to Regulations, Services, and Processes in Taxation \nYears of experience in the selected areas of specialization \n \nThus, the information provided in the screener questionnaire allows the team to better understand the \nexperts\u2019 professions, areas of specialization, and knowledge or experience related to taxation. \n \nIV. PARAMETERS \n \nTo ensure comparability of the data collected from expert consultations across economies, the Taxation \ntopic uses general parameters. A parameter refers to an assumption about location, tax residency, sector \nand activity. Questionnaire respondents are presented with these parameters and asked to evaluate a \nstandardized scenario that permits comparability across locations, jurisdictions, and economies. \n \n5.1 General Parameters \n \nTax regulations and their applicability may vary depending on the location , residency status , sector and \nnature of business activity. To strike a balance between cross-economy comparability and economy-specific \nrepresentativeness, the Taxation topic employs the following general parameters to provide contextual \ninformation for experts to identify the appropriate regulations , services and practices to be assessed in \ndifferent pillars. \n \n5.1.1 Business Location\n \nJustification: \nGeographic location determines the applicable local corporate profit-based, consumption, environmental, \nand labor taxes and contributions when taxes are administered at multiple levels or at a local level. These \nfactors may affect the availability of online services, the process of tax registration and deregistration, the \nparties involved in the review of tax complaints, and more. Thus, business location is an essential parameter \nfor assessing the regulatory framework and public services in taxation. The largest city is chosen based on \nthe population size as detailed in the Overview of this Methodology Handbook. \n \nApplication: \nFor Pillar I, the parameter is used in cases when local regulations are applicable in addition to the national \nones. In economies where regulations differ across states, the regulations of the largest city are measured. \nFor Pillar II, the parameter determine s the applicable taxes and procedures. For Pillar III, it applies only \nwhen the data are collected through expert consultations rather than Enterprise Surveys. \n \n5.1.2 Tax Residency\u2013Tax Resident of the Assessed Economy \nJustification:"

    "content": "It is common that a jurisdiction\u2019s tax residents and nonresidents (that is, tax residents of another jurisdiction) \nare subjected to different rules, requirements, and regulations. The regulatory framework that applies to tax \nresidents of other jurisdictions is often complemented by the double tax treaties. When a double tax treaty \napplies, its details are defined by the agreement between two jurisdictions and may substantially vary across \nparties. The inclusion of nonresidents taxation may, therefore, becom e overly complicated and result in \ndata that are hardly comparable. As a result, the Taxation topic focuses only on companies that are tax \nresidents of the measured jurisdiction. \n \nApplication: \nThe parameter of the tax residency is relevant to all measures of the Taxation topic. In Pillar I, it defines \nthe applicable rules and regulations, while in Pillar II, the tax residency determines the specific processes, \nprocedures, and services that the companies undergo. In Pillar III, this parameter is integral in setting the \ncompliance requirements that, in turn, define the time and cost to complete the specific processes. \n \n5.1.3 Sector and Activity\u2013Excluding Mineral, Extractive, and Financial Sectors\n \nJustification: \nTaxation of mineral, extractive, and financial sectors can differ from regular taxation in many ways. Mineral \nand extractive industries often involve complex contractual arrangements, such as production sharing \nagreements or joint venture arrangements, that can make taxation more complex. Companies in these \nsectors often operate across borders, which can raise complex international tax issues, such as transfer \npricing and double tax treaty provisions. These issues may not be relevant for regular companies t hat \noperate only within a single jurisdiction. Additionally, the valuation of mineral and extractive resources can \nbe difficult, requiring specialized knowledge and techniques. In the financial sector, the complexity of \ntaxation arises given that financial institutions engage in a wide variety of activities\u2014including provision \nof loans, trading, investment banking, and wealth management \u2014often across multiple jurisdictions. \nFurthermore, financial institutions are subject to extensive regulation, which can create additional \ncomplexity in the tax system. For example, some jurisdictions may offer tax incentives for certain types of \nfinancial activity, while others may impose additional taxes or reporting requirements. To allow data \ncomparability, the Taxation topic excludes matters related to taxation of mineral, extractive, and financial \nsectors. \n \nApplication: \nThe sector parameter is relevant to all three pillars. The regulatory framework and public services for the \nmineral, extractive, and financial sectors often differ from those applicable to regular companies. Therefore, \nincluding them could skew the data and reduce comparability. When it comes to efficiency, companies in \nmineral, extractive, and financial sectors often require specialized knowledge and resources to comply with \ntaxation, which can be time-consuming and expensive. By excluding them, the Taxation topic can provide \na more standardized approach to the efficiency of taxation, allowing for better data comparability. \n \n5.2 Specific Parameters \n \nThe Taxation topic does not employ specific parameters that are applicable to one or two pillars. \n \nV. TOPIC SCORING \n \nThe Taxation topic has three pillars: Pillar I\u2013Quality of Tax Regulations; Pillar II\u2013Public Services Provided \nto Corporate Taxpayers; and Pillar III\u2013Efficiency of Tax System in Practice. The total points for each pillar \nare further rescaled to values from 0 to 100 and subsequently aggregated into the total topic score. Each \npillar contributes one- third to the total topic score. The scores distinguish between benefits to the firm \n(captured as firm flexibility points) and benefits to society\u2019s broader interes ts (captured as social benefits"

The scoring for each category under this pillar is as follows: \n \n6.1.1 Clarity and Transparency has 4 indicators with a total maximum score of 8 points (4 points on firm \nflexibility and 4 points on social benefits). Specifically, each of the two Subcategories\u2014Clarity of \nTax Regulations and Transparency of Changes in Tax Regulations\u2014has 2 indicators. A regulatory \nframework that ensures transparency and clarity of tax regulations benefits both firms (firm \nflexibility) and society (social benefits). Hence, equal points are assigned to both categories. \n \n6.1.2 Administrative Procedures has 4 indicators with a total maximum score of 8 points (4 points on \nfirm flexibility and 4 points on social benefits). Specifically, each of the four Subcategories\u2014\nSimplified Tax Record Keeping and Reporting, General Tax Registration, Consumption-Based Tax \nRegistration, and VAT Refund\u2014has 1 indicator. A regulatory framework that ensures solid legal \nframework on administrative procedures benefits both firms (firm flexibility) and society (social \nbenefits). Hence, equal points are assigned to both categories. \n \n6.1.3 Environmental Fiscal Instruments has 4 indicators with a total maximum score of 6 points (2 point \non firm flexibility and 4 points on social benefits).

The Annotated Questionnaire \nprovides the mapping between each indicator and the corresponding question(s). \n \nGlossary \n \nAppeal: The process where a higher authority reviews a decision made in a dispute, typically used when \none party is dissatisfied with the outcome of the initial decision. The higher authority, which can be a higher \ncourt, an administrative agency, or an independent body, examines the case and makes a new decision. \n \nCarbon pricing instruments (CPIs): Policy instruments that impose a cost on emitting carbon dioxide \nand other greenhouse gases to incentivize emission reductions. While there are many types of CPIs, the two \nmain types of CPIs in climate mitigation are carbon taxes and Emissions Trading Systems (ETS), also \nknown as cap-and-trade. \n \nCarbon taxes: Tax imposed on carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions or non- renewable fossil fuels based on \ntheir carbon content. \n \nComplaint on a tax audit assessment: An objection filed by a taxpayer or their representative against the \noutcome of a tax audit conducted by a tax authority. \n \nConsumption-based taxes: Taxes typically levied on the purchase of goods or services , paid directly or \nindirectly by the final consumer. The most common consumption taxes include value added tax (VAT), \ngoods and services tax (GST), and sales tax. For the purposes of this questionnaire, these do not include \nexcise taxes, import duties, or taxes specific to import. \n \nCore taxes: For the purpose of this questionnaire, core taxes encompass three categories: (1) corporate \nincome-based taxes, (2) consumption- based taxes (VAT, GST, or similar consumption taxes), and (3) \nemployment-based taxes and social contributions. \n \nCorporate income-based taxes: Taxes levied on a company\u2019s profit or turnover (when a turnover is used \nas a proxy of profit). Taxes that are levied on turnover as a measure of sales are not included here and are \ninstead classified as consumption -based taxes. The most common type is corporate income tax (CIT). \nTaxation of mineral, extractive, and financial sectors is excluded from the assessment. \n \nDigital trade: All forms of economic activity conducted via digital networks, including digitally enabled \ntransactions of goods and services. This includes services like cloud computing, data storage, and \nprocessing, as well as the online sale and delivery of goods and services. Digital trade involves both the \nproduction of digital goods (e.g., software, digital media, and online services) and the use of digital \nprocesses to facilitate traditional trade (e.g., e-commerce, online ordering, and electronic payments). It may \nalso involve consumers, firms, and governments. \n \nDirect emission approach: An approach to carbon taxation where the tax is levied directly on the amount \nof carbon emissions produced. \n \nE-invoicing: A system for generating, transmitting, and processing invoices electronically using a \nstandardized digital format (e.g., XML, JSON, EDIFACT, PEPPOL BIS). This excludes invoices in PDF, \nWord/Excel, or scanned formats. E-invoicing facilitates real-time, or near real-time, data sharing with tax \nadministrations, supporting automatic pre-filling of tax returns."

    "content": "Electronic filing (e-filing): The process of submitting tax returns via the internet using computers or mobile \ndevices, without requiring any physical interactions (with tax authority, banks, or any other parties). If hard \ncopies of tax returns are required to be stored (e.g., for audit purposes) or submitted, it is not considered as \nan electronic filing. \n \nElectronic payment (e-payment): A payment request submitted online via computers or mobile devices, \nwithout requiring physical interactions (with a bank, tax authority, or any other parties). Examples include \nonline banking, direct payments on tax authority websites, etc. If hard copies of payment transactions \nrecords are required to be stored or submitted in person, it is not considered an electronic payment. \n \nEmission trading system (ETS): A carbon pricing instrument where emitters receive emission allowances \nor permits that can be traded with other emitters. It sets a cap on total emissions within a specific area and \nallocates permits to emission sources through auctions, free allowances, o r both. Emitters can use their \npermits or sell them to others. \n \nEmployment-based taxes and social contributions: Employer-reported levies on employee headcount or \ncompensation, including salaries, wages, and benefits. This includes all employment related taxes and social \ncontributions reported by the employer, either remitted directly or withheld from employees\u2019 sala ries. \nPersonal income taxes are included only if they are withheld and reported by employer. Social contributions \nmay include payments to unemployment insurance, pension funds, disability insurance, medical insurance \nand similar contributions. \n \nFeedback from taxpayer: Feedback from corporate taxpayers that is proactively requested and obtained \nby independent third parties or tax administration. This can take form of focus groups, surveys, online \nfeedback platforms, panels, and forums. \n \nFinancial performance: A measurement of tax administration\u2019s overall financial efficiency, typically \npresented in financial performance reports on an annual basis. These reports offer a detailed overview of \nthe financial activities, achievements, and efficiency of a tax administ ration over a specific period. They \nevaluate key metrics such as revenue collection and expenditure details and often include the financial \nstatements of the tax administration, along with compliance and enforcement statistics. \n \nFossil fuel subsidies: Policy instruments that directly or indirectly reduce the price paid by end users for \nfossil fuels or the energy generated from them. These subsidies may apply to primary fuels (such as coal, \ncrude oil, and natural gas) and secondary energy (such as electricity and heating). Dire ct subsidies lower \nconsumer prices through monetary transfers. Indirect subsidies include tax expenditures, price controls, \ndiscounts, or other measures that prevent full cost recovery, thereby artificially reducing end- user prices \nand creating distortions in energy access, pricing, and competitiveness. For the purposes of B-READY, the \nmeasurement of fossil fuel subsidies is limited to consumer-side support mechanisms that reduce end-user \nprices. While producer -side measures (e.g., tax breaks for exploration and extraction) also constitute \nsubsidies, they fall outside the scope of this assessment, which does not cover the oil and gas industry. \n \nGeneral tax guidance: I nformation and instructions provided by tax authorities to assist taxpayers \nunderstand and comply with tax laws and regulations. This can be in the form of tax guides, tax briefs, \npractice notes, and factsheets, which clarify tax obligations, explain filing requirements, and provide \npractical advice for managing t ax-related matters effectively. It is typically informational and not legally \nbinding. \n \nIndependent complaint review mechanism: Structurally and functionally independent body or unit \nwithin a tax administration that adjudicates taxpayer complaints on tax audit assessments. Such a body or \nunit is considered independent only if staff/officers who conduct the review have not participa ted in the"

However, the review may be conducted \nby a separate unit that reports to the head of the tax administration, as long as it is organizationally distinct \nfrom the audit unit. \n \nInternal tax guidance: Guidelines produced specifically for tax administration staff, detailing policies and \nprocedures they should follow in their duties. These provide technical advice issued internally to help staff \nunderstand and apply tax laws and regulations consistently a cross different tax offices or units. Examples \ninclude revenue procedure, internal revenue manuals, and technical advice memorandums. \n \nLegislative or administrative act: Legal instruments enacted by a legislative or administrative bodies with \ngeneral binding force at any government level (e.g., federal, state, or municipal) or administrative level \n(ministry of finance, tax authority). These include codes, laws, statutes, regulations, ordinances, and \ndecrees. \n \nLocal tax representative : An individual or entity appointed to act on behalf of a taxpayer in a specific \njurisdiction, responsible for fulfilling the taxpayer's VAT/GST obligations. Some economies require a local \ntax representative when suppliers have tax obligations but no physical presence in the jurisdiction. \n \nMeasurement, reporting, and verification (MRV): A system used in carbon pricing that allows to record \ncarbon emissions. MRV systems can operate at the facility level or at the sector level. At the facility level \neach facility is responsible for tracking its fuel usage, estimating emissions based on carbon content and \nreporting this information to the relevant government agency. At the sector level emissions are aggregated \nand assessed across an entire industry or sector. While individual facilities may not report emissions \ndirectly, they may be required to maintain internal records or report production volumes, fuel use or energy \nconsumption to support sector-level estimates. \n \nOperational performance: A measurement of tax administration\u2019s operational efficiency, typically \npresented in operational performance reports on an annual basis. These reports evaluate the tax authority\u2019s \ncore functions and processes, including metrics on management and accountability, taxpayer services (e.g., \nassistance programs, filing services, educational outreach), and enforcement activities. It may also cover \nthe organizational structure, leadership roles, and strategic initiatives aimed to enhance op erational \nefficiency and effectiveness. \n \nPre-filled electronic declaration: Preparation or pre-filling of a tax declaration by the tax administration, \nusing information from third parties (such as banks and financial institutions, suppliers, etc.), as well as \nfrom previously submitted tax declarations, or directly from the taxpayers\u2019 tax accounting if such data \nsharing is established. Also referred to as \u2018pre- populated declarations,\u2019 these declarations substantially \nsimplify the effort required by corporate taxpayers for annual tax filing. The bas ic pre-filled information \ncan include corporate taxpayer\u2019s registration details, estimated income and expenses, and taxes withheld or \npaid in advance. Advanced pre-filled information includes the calculation of final tax liability or other near-\nfinal calculations. \n \nPrivate binding rulings: Binding statements written by the government (tax authority or other dedicated \ninstitution) in response to specific requests from corporate taxpayers seeking clarification about tax \ntreatment of a planned or completed transaction or other specific circumstances. Corporate taxpayers who \nfollowed the ruling cannot be later penalized by the tax authority, even if the ruling is retroactively deemed \nincorrect. In some jurisdictions, these are known as \u201cadvance rulings.\u201d For the purposes of this \nquestionnaire, advance rulings are included only if any corporate taxpayer can request such a ruling."

Corporate taxpayers who followed the ruling cannot be later penalized by the tax authority, even \nif the ruling is retroactively deemed incorrect. General tax guidance or instructions are not considered public \nbinding rulings. Public binding rulings address very specific transactions rather than provide broad \nexplanations of how the tax authority interprets or applies the law. \n \nSingle-entry bookkeeping: A bookkeeping method where each transaction is recorded as a single-entry in \nthe tax journal. It is generally used for cash-based accounting. \n \nTax audit manuals and guidelines: Comprehensive documents intended to guide auditors in conducting \naudits of corporate taxpayers. They provide a framework for planning, preparation, and executing tax \naudits, as well as preparing reports and results. These also describe methods and techniques for assessing \nthe correctness of a taxpayer\u2019s liability, as well as the principles, standards, and code of ethics for auditors. \n \nTax audit plan: A strategic framework outlining the tax administration's annual plan for conducting audits. \nIt typically includes information on audit coverage for various taxes and key taxpayer segments, selection \nof audit cases (e.g., by prioritizing high-risk areas and centrally selecting cases based on risk assessments), \ntypes of audits to be conducted, allocation of resources and timeline. The plan must contain at least the \nselection criteria, but it is not required that an explicit list of taxpayers that will be audited is published. \n \nTax ombudsman: An independent, non-judicial entity focused on recommending solutions for taxpayer \ncomplaints, distinct from judicial bodies that provide formal judicial processes. The ombudsman has the \nauthority to investigate service -related complaints, including mistakes, omissions, oversights, or other \nadministrative issues, and can make suggestions to the tax administration. It must be independent from the \ntax administration and must possess expertise in tax-related matters to review tax cases. It can be a separate \nbody or a division within a general ombudsman\u2019s office. \n \nTax records: Documents created exclusively or partially for tax purposes. Tax records often include VAT \ninvoices, tax books and records, tax declarations/returns, payment slips, and any other documentation \nrequired to verify reported income, expenses, credits, and deductions. These may include financial records \nthat businesses normally maintain (e.g., balance sheets, profit and loss accounts, cash flow statements, \ninvoices receipts, asset records, etc.) if such records are required to be submitted to the tax authority \nregularly or upon request. \n \nTaxpayer portal: An electronic gateway that uses secure authentication to provide corporate taxpayers and \ntheir authorized agents with online access to tax information, services, and functions. Such portal is \ndifferent from the general website as it enables users to update bank account and/or contact details (e.g., \naddress and telephone number); view, prepare, file, and adjust tax reporting documents; make financial \ntransactions (e.g., pay taxes and request refunds); communicate with the tax administration via secure \nchannels; and access historical files and communication. \n \nUnified Identification Number (UIN): A unique identifier assigned to a corporate taxpayer by a public \nagency or regulatory body to streamline tracking and management of their affairs. It may be part of a \nUnified Business Identifier (UBI), which goes beyond taxation to include business registration, licensing, \nand other r egulatory requirements, aiming to eliminate multiple identification numbers across different \nregulatory regimes."

    "content": "CHAPTER 9. DISPUTE RESOLUTION\u2013METHODOLOGY NOTE \n \nI. MOTIVATION \n \nIn developed and developing economies alike, commercial disputes inevitably occur. Adverse economic \noutcomes for the private sector, ranging from reduced entrepreneurial activity and lower investment to \nmacroeconomic volatility, can arise when these disputes cannot be adequately resolved.1 This makes a well-\nfunctioning dispute resolution system essential for a healthy business environment. Such a system requires \nefficiency and quality.2 \n \nHaving time- and cost-effective mechanisms for resolving disputes is critical because excessively long and \nexpensive proceedings may defeat the very purpose of bringing a case to formal institutions, making them \nunattractive and unaffordable.\n3 In fact, correlations have been established between judicial efficiency and \nfacilitated entrepreneurial activity. 4 Evidence also suggests that under a more effective court system , \nbusinesses are likely to have greater access to finance and borrow more.5 In addition, expeditious judiciaries \nare associated with higher levels of domestic and foreign investment. 6 When investors know that, in case \nof nonperformance of an obligation, their claim will be considered in a timely manner, they may have more \nincentives to increase investment. 7 Also, enhancing the efficiency of the judiciary may strengthen \ncompetition and foster innovation.8 \n \nThe quality of the dispute resolution process also matters.\n9 Claims should be considered with due care by \ncredible institutions capable of issuing sound judgments. 10 In economies with low confidence in court \nsystems, firms are less willing to expand their businesses and look for alternative trade partners.11 To attract \nmore investors, economies should ensure not only judiciaries\u2019 effectiveness but also their strength and \nreliability.12 Limited enforceability of contracts is associated with the suboptimal distribution of resources, \nthe use of inefficient technologies, and greater macroeconomic volatility. 13 Because poor commercial \ndispute resolution might deprive firms of timely and full payments, liquidity and insolvency issues can \nfollow, as can subsequent bankruptcies and unemployment.14 \n \nEfficient and quality dispute resolution systems require a clear and up- to-date regulatory framework and \nenhanced public services. 15 Robust laws and regulations are vital because they lay the foundation for \nresolving disputes in a timely and trustworthy manner.16 Well-designed regulatory frameworks must be put \ninto effect through a sound public services system. 17 Key elements of such a system include solid \norganizational structure , high degree of digitalization, increased transparency, and advanced services \nrelated to alternative dispute resolution (ADR). 18 In light of this, the Dispute Resolution topic focuses on \nquality of regulations and public services, as well as the operational efficiency with which these are applied \nin practice. \n \nII. INDICATORS \n \nThe Dispute Resolution topic measures the efficiency and quality of the resolution of commercial \ndisputes\u2014those arising in the business context between firms\u2014across three different dimensions, referred \nto as pillars. The first pillar assesses the adequacy of legislation pertaining to both court processes and \nalternative dispute resolution, covering de jure features that are necessary for the efficient processing of \ncases, facilitated resolution of cross- border claims, creating alternative venues for settling disputes, and \nensuring trust in relevant institutions. The second pillar measures judicial organizational structure, courts\u2019 \ndigitalization and transparency, as well as ADR -related services, thus capturing the de facto provision of \npublic services. The third pillar measures the reliability of dispute resolution, the time and cost required to \nresolve a dispute, as well as the time and cost associated with the recognition and enforcement of decisions. \nEach pillar is divided into categories \u2014defined by common features that inform the grouping into a \nparticular category\u2014and each category is further divided into subcategories.

For example, such rules permit \nthe use of apostilles and ensure that the local court is not allowed to review foreign judgments on the \nmerits.25 As to enforcement proceedings, they can be facilitated by providing enforcement agents with \nexplicit powers to seize more classes of assets, such as the debtor\u2019s monetary claims toward a third party, \nfinancial instruments, or electronic assets (such as cry ptocurrency).\n26 Therefore, Subcategory 1.1. 1\u2013\nProcedural Certainty comprises seven indicators (table 3). \n \nTable 3.

For example, the law can tackle this issue by removing restrictions for public bodies and state-\nowned enterprises to use arbitration in resolving commercial and investment disputes.36 Ensuring the right \nto freely choose legal counsel or allowing third-party funding to help smaller businesses cover their legal \ncosts can increase openness of arbitration proceedings.37 \n \nAnother key element of a robust regulatory framework on arbitration is the recognition of the \u201ckompetenz-\nkompetenz\u201d principle, which empowers an arbitral tribunal to rule on its own jurisdiction and requires \ndomestic courts to defer to the arbitral tribunal on this question.\n38 Considering that the judiciary performs \nthe primary role in a ny dispute resolution system, court support is crucial for making arbitration truly \nattractive, in particular, in the collection of evidence. 39 Moreover, the attractiveness of arbitration can be \nfurther enhanced if the legislation sets out a straightforward, up -to-date, and predictable regime for \nrecognizing and enforcing arbitral awards. Such a regime allows for recognition and enforcement of interim \nand partial awards as well as ensures that domestic and foreign awards may not be reviewed on the grounds \nof error of law or fact. 40 Therefore, Subcategory 1.2.1\u2013Legal Safeguards in Arbitration comprises six \nindicators (table 5)."

Several good practices have proven to facilitate the conduct of mediation proceedings. \nAs in arbitration, it is essential to guarantee respect for parties\u2019 autonomy in mediation. Prescribing that \ncommercial mediation is voluntary, for example, helps arrange that only parties interested in an amicable \nsettlement resort to it. 41 Safeguards of independence and impartiality are also relevant for mediation. In \nparticular, these include establishing rules on the disclosure of conflict of interest by the mediator. 42 \nAnother crucial guarantee in mediation relates to ensuring that suggestions and statements made for the \npurpose of mediation may not be used in other proceedings. 43 Further, mediation may become more \nappealing when the legal framework provides for a streamlined enforcement regime for mediation \nagreements and also allows for recognition of international mediation agreements. 44 Therefore, \nSubcategory 1.2.2\u2013Legal Safeguards in Mediation comprises four indicators (table 6). \n \nTable 6.

Within such a framework, aspects of court specialization, access to justice, and integrity play an \nessential role.\n45 Ensuring that commercial cases are handled by specialized courts or divisions at the level \nof first instance may have a positive impact on the efficiency and quality of dispute resolution. 46 Due to \ntheir unique nature, international cases may benefit from increased specialization too. This can be ensured \nby establishing a court or division of a court dedicated to hearing international commercial matters and \nsetting up a public agency or government unit tasked specifically with the prevention and early resolution \nof investor-state disputes.47 \n \nAccess to justice matters in commercial litigation too, with micro and small businesses being particularly \nvulnerable in this regard.48 To ensure access to justice for all market participants, economies may establish \nsmall claims courts or procedures, as well as create legal aid programs targeting entrepreneurs who cannot \nafford legal costs.49 Furthermore, in administering justice, complaints may often arise with respect to how \nthe dispute resolution system is organized and how cases are handled in practice. If left unaddressed, these \ncomplaints may lead to a decline in institutional credibility and cause procedural inefficiencies.

A transparent dispute resolution system is \nassociated with an increased degree of public control over courts and proceedings, and it provides the parties \nwith more certainty about the handling of their cases. This starts with ensuring that all legal instruments \n(laws, regulations, directives, orders, and so on) are published free of charge.\n56 Apart from laws and \nregulations, it is also vital to publish judgments of both first instance and higher courts.57 As to the conduct \nof proceedings, the principle of transparency requires granting public access to hearings, whether they are \nheld in person or online.58 \n \nThe credibility of the judiciary may further grow if the dispute resolution system demonstrates a \ncommitment to collecting and publishing information about its organization and performance. To begin \nwith, it is important to make publicly available the statistics on the number of judges, providing for \ndisaggregation by the individual court, the level of the court, as well as by the sex of the judges.\n59 Further, \nit is essential to produce and release key statistics about performance, such as data on the time it takes to \nadjudicate different categories of cases and the number of cases resolved versus the number of incoming \ncases.\n60 Publication of information is of no less significance in enforcement, where data on the average \nlength of proceedings and number of resolved and unresolved cases represents a particular interest. 61 \nTherefore, Subcategory 2.1.3\u2013Transparency of Courts (includes gender) comprises seven indicators (table \n10). \n \nTable 10.

ADR mechanisms, \nsuch as arbitration and mediation, are typically more flexible than courts and thus may be better suited to \nthe parties\u2019 specific needs. Considering their wide use, arbitration services \u2014for both domestic and \ninternational cases\u2014stand out as particularly important.\n62 The availability of such services is confirmed by \nthe existence of actual commercial cases resolved through arbitration. 63 Arbitration can be made more \nattractive if the arbitration institution provide s for special procedures intended to make the process more \nefficient. These include emergency arbitration, early dismissal, expedited (fast -track) arbitration, and \nconsolidation of related arbitral proceedings and joinder of additional parties.64 \n \nTo further promote arbitration, a roster of qualified arbitrators may be set up , while also ensuring that \nchoosing arbitrators outside the roster is not prohibited.\n65 According to a different good practice, arbitration \ninstitutions can check the quality of draft arbitral awards prior to their formal issuance .66 To keep up with \nthe latest trends, arbitration services should embrace digit alization, which includes developing a relevant \nonline platform, enabling virtual conferences and hearings, and introducing electronic signing.67 Moreover, \ntransparency is critical for the credibility of arbitration. This fosters arbitration institutions to collect and \ndisclose statistics on the number of handled cases, time to resolve disputes, number of appointments of \narbitrators disaggregated by sex, as well as to publish summaries of arbitral awards. 68 Therefore, \nSubcategory 2.2.1\u2013Public Services for Arbitration (includes gender) comprises five indicators (table 11). \n \nTable 11.

The creditor may be required \nto initiate enforcement proceedings should the losing party refuse to comply voluntarily with the \njudgment.\n79 To ensure that businesses are not deprived of justice, such proceedings should also be handled \nin an efficient manner. In fact, it is in the creditor\u2019s best interests to complete the enforcement process \nswiftly and with minimal extra costs.

When \nbusinesses have sufficient confidence in ADR mechanisms, they are more likely to resort to them in \npractice.80 In contrast, when there is a lack of credibility in arbitration an d mediation, such mechanisms \nmay remain barely used, contributing to the backlog of cases in the judiciary and depriving firms of efficient \nand flexible alternatives. Therefore, Subcategory 3.2.1\u2013Reliability of ADR has two indicators (table 16). \n \nTable 16.

The cost for arbitration is \ncomprised of attorneys\u2019, arbitrators \u2019, and administrative fees incurred by the claimant in this process . \nForeign arbitral awards are, as a rule, subject to the process of recognition before domestic courts , and its \nefficiency can vary significantly. 82 The two key measures in this process are the time it takes for a local \ncourt to consider a request for recognizing a foreign arbitral award and the associated cost, consisting of \nattorney and court fees. Therefore, Subcategory 3.2.2\u2013Operational Efficiency of Arbitration-Related \nProcesses comprises four indicators (table 17). \n \nTable 17.

Private sector arbitrators and mediators may be contacted too, when relevant. The data for Pillar III \nare obtained through expert consultations and Enterprise Surveys. In particular, the data on Operational \nEfficiency of Court Processes, Reliability of ADR, and Operational Efficiency of Arbitration- Related \nProcesses are collected through private sector experts, while the data on Reliability of Courts are collected \nby way of Enterprise Surveys. \n \nEnterprise Surveys provide representative data on the reliability of dispute resolution , as experienced by \nbusinesses in practice.

For more details on the collection of data by Enterprise Surveys, please refer to the Overview \nchapter of this Methodology Handbook. \n \n4.2 Screening and Selection of Experts \n \nThe Dispute Resolution topic has one questionnaire. A screener questionnaire is used to assist the selection \nof experts receiving the Dispute Resolution topic questionnaire based on a set of criteria (table 18). \n \nTable 18.\n Screener Questionnaire and Respondent Criteria \nRelevant Experts\u2019 Professions \nPrivate sector lawyers/attorneys, arbitrators, and mediators \nRelevant Areas of Specialization \nCommercial litigation, commercial arbitration, commercial mediation, international dispute resolution, environmental law, and \nenforcement proceedings in commercial cases \nAssessment of Experts\u2019 Knowledge and Experience Related to Commercial Dispute Resolution and Associated \nRegulations, Services, and Processes \nKnowledge of and experience with preparing documents on behalf of firms to initiate commercial litigation, arbitration, or \nmediation; representing firms before courts, arbitration tribunals, and mediators; participating in international commercial \ndispute resolution; handling environmental cases; conducting proceedings to recognize foreign arbitral awards; and undertaking \ncompulsory proceedings to enforce final commercial judgments \n \nThus, the information provided in the screener questionnaire allows the team to better understand the \nexperts\u2019 professions, areas of specialization, and knowledge or experience related to dispute resolution \nprocesses. \n \nIV. PARAMETERS \n \nTo ensure comparability of the data from expert consultations across economies, the Dispute Resolution \ntopic uses general and specific parameters. A parameter refers to an assumption that is made about the \nbusiness location (across all pillars), level of court (Pillar II only), and claim value (Pillar III only). \nQuestionnaire respondents are presented with these parameters and asked to evaluate a standardized \nscenario that permits comparability across locations, jurisdictions, and economies. \n \n5.1 General Parameters \n \nDispute Resolution employs one general parameter, business location. It applies across all pillars and to \nboth court litigation and ADR. Many economies have subnational jurisdictions, which require a business \nlocation to be specified in order for experts to identify the relevant regulatory framework to be assessed. \n \n5.1.1 Business Location \nJustification: \nGeographic location is a key parameter for assessing the efficiency and reliability of dispute resolution. \nAcross all pillars, the Dispute Resolution topic focuses on the largest city. Regarding Pillar I, the regulatory \nframework governing dispute resolution may be subject to subnational differences in many economies. \nGiven that legal instruments may have country, regional, or municipal characters, this parameter is \nnecessary to ensure the accuracy of the data. In Pillar II, geographic location is even more important because \nthe availability and quality of public services often vary substantially depending on a specific location \nwithin an economy. Focusing on the largest city is therefore important for the purposes of comparability \nand data quality. Similarly, in Pillar III, the operational efficiency of dispute resolution is prone to \ndifferences based on business location. For example, it may take significantly more time and cost to resolve \na case in a city where there is a high demand for dispute resolution, compared to another city in the economy"

    "content": "where demand is relatively low. Using the largest city as a reference point, therefore, helps guarantee that \nall economies are treated equally, and that the data are comparable. The largest city is chosen based on the \npopulation size, as detailed in the Overview chapter of this Methodology Handbook. \n \nApplication: \nIn Pillar I and Pillar II, the parameter of business location is used to determine the specific city in which \nthe quality of regulations and public services for dispute resolution are assessed. In Pillar III, this parameter \napplies only in cases when the data are collected through expert consultations, not through Enterprise \nSurveys. Specifically, the parameter is relevant for measures in the categories of Operational Efficiency of \nCourt Processes, Reliability of ADR, and Operational Efficiency of Arbitration-Related Processes. \n \n5.2 Specific Parameters \n \nDispute Resolution employs two specific parameters. One is level of court, which applies to Pillar II only. \nThe other one is the claim value, relevant only for Pillar III. \n \n5.2.1 Level of Court \nJustification: \nAvailability and quality of public services may vary depending on the level of court (that is, first instance \ncourt, appellate court, supreme court, and so on). For example, the extent of digitalization in first instance \ncourts can be significantly lower than in the apex court, which often has more resources. In terms of \ntransparency, the nature and amount of released information may differ across various court levels, too. To \nensure comparability of the data, in Pillar II, the topic will focus on public services in first instance courts. \nGenerally, these are the first courts that adjudicate disputes and, accordingly, most cases go through them. \nSelecting first instance courts as a proxy also yields better representativeness because the data are relevant \nto the experience of most litigants. \n \nApplication: \nThe parameter of court level applies only to Pillar II and solely as regards its category of Court Litigation. \nWithin this category, it is relevant to all three subcategories as they specifically assess judicial services: \nOrganizational Structure of Courts, Digitalization of Court Processes, and Transparency of Courts (includes \ngender). The parameter does not apply to the Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) category. \n \n5.2.2 Claim Value \nJustification: \nThe time and cost characteristics of dispute resolution can vary depending on the claim value. Resources \nrequired to resolve a highly complex and extensive case that involves dozens of businesses are typically \ndifferent from the resources needed to settle a straightforward dispute between two small firms. \nImportantly, the parameter of claim value has a substantial impact not only on the time and cost to resolve \na dispute, but also on the efficiency of proceedings related to recognition of foreign arbitral awards. To \nensure comparability of the data, it is therefore essential to use this parameter. \n \nApplication: \nThe Dispute Resolution topic assumes that the claim value is equal to 20 times the economy\u2019s gross national \nincome (GNI) per capita. This amount is considered because it ensures that the dispute is of sufficient \nsignificance to firms: that is, the losses would be material if they decide not to pursue the case. In a similar \nvein, this amount makes the case attractive to attorneys. The indicated claim value also makes it clear that \nthe resolution of the dispute across all economies would require using a regular court procedure, rather than \na simplified one. At the same time, the amount of 20 times the economy\u2019s GNI per capita indicates that the \ncase is typical and not too expensive; a higher amount could skew the data toward the experience of large \ncorporations. To sum up, the value of the claim reflects the amount of common commercial cases; it is"

In line with this assumption, whenever 20 times the economy\u2019s GNI per capita is less than US$ \n20,000, the topic assumes that the claim value is equal to US$20,000. \n \nV. TOPIC SCORING \n \nThe Dispute Resolution topic has three pillars: Pillar I\u2013Quality of Regulations for Dispute Resolution; Pillar \nII\u2013Public Services for Dispute Resolution; and Pillar III \u2013Ease of Resolving a Commercial Dispute. The \ntotal number of points for each pillar is further rescaled to values from 0 to 100, and subsequently \naggregated into the total topic score. Each pillar contributes one- third to the total topic score. The scores \ndistinguish between benefits to the firm (captured as firm flexibility points) and benefits to society\u2019s broader \ninterests (captured as social benefits points). Table 19 shows the scoring for the Dispute Resolution topic. \nFor further scoring details, please see Annex A, which complements this section. \n \nTable 19.

The scoring for each category under this pillar is as follows: \n \n6.1.1 Court Litigation has 15 indicators with a total maximum score of 29 points (14 points on firm \nflexibility and 15 points on social benefits). Specifically, the Procedural Certainty Subcategory has \n7 indicators, while the Judicial Competence (includes gender and environment) Subcategory has 8 \nindicators. Both businesses (firm flexibility) and society at large (social benefits) benefit from a \nregulatory framework that ensures the efficiency and quality of court litigation . Hence, in most \ncases, equal points are assigned to both categories. The only exception is the Environmental \nDisputes indicator, where points are not assigned to firm flexibility. This stems from the fact that \nonce the legal framework makes it easier to lodge an environmental claim against a business, some \nfirms may lose as they will be con strained to adjust their operations to environmentally friendly \nrules. Other firms, however, are likely to win because the clean environment will allow them to set \nlong-term goals. \n \n \n6.1.2 Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) has 10 indicators with a total maximum score of 20 points \n(10 points on firm flexibility and 10 on social benefits). In particular, the Legal Safeguards in \nArbitration Subcategory has 6 indicators, and the Legal Safeguards in Mediation subcategory has \n4 indicators.

Does the legal framework incorporate the principle of \u201ckompetenz-kompetenz\u201d? (Y/N) \nNote: The principle of \u201ckompetenz-kompetenz\u201d recognizes, on the one hand, the power of the arbitral \ntribunal to determine its own jurisdiction under an arbitration agreement and, on the other hand, that \ncourts should defer to the arbitral tribunal over disputes relating to jurisdiction at the outset of \nproceedings, unless the underlying agreement is prima facie null and void. \n \n37.

MOTIVATION \n \nThere is substantial economic evidence that a fair level of market competition spurs economic growth by \nincreasing industry and firm innovation and productivity, leading to better products, more and better jobs, \nand higher incomes. 1 By affecting market entry and exit, competition stimulates product innovation and \nservice quality, protects consumers, and forces market operators to provide their products and services at \ncost.2 But competition is rarely perfect. Markets fail either due to firms\u2019 behaviors or government \ninterventions. Market power\u2014a firm\u2019s ability to raise prices well above cost, offer a low -quality good or \nservice, and drive out competition\u2014must be kept in check.3 \n \nGovernments have a wide range of tools to deter anticompetitive behaviors, promote market entry, ensure \na fair level of competition, and reduce distortions created by market failures.4 Competition policy is the set \nof policies and laws that ensure that competition in the marketplace is not restricted in a way that reduces \neconomic welfare.5 Crucial for the business environment and the economy, competition policy can help \nalleviate poverty and foster shared prosperity. In some major markets where governments are the sole or \nprincipal buyer (for example, education, health, and infrastructure), the design and implementation of \ngovernment regulations directly influence market entry and firm behavior.6 \n \nHaving a dynamic and competitive market is key for faster growth and lower prices, which in conjunction \nwith other policies is crucial for poverty eradication. Having a well -enforced competition law helps poor \nproducers as well as poor consumers by enforcing the breaking up of cartels, exposing dominant firms that \nengage in anticompetitive conduct to more competition, and by reducing barriers to entry, helping small \nfirms enter the market and survive. Market entry provides a dual benefit to the poor, not only by helping \nthem as consumers by putting downward pressure on prices, but also by expanding their employment and \nsmall business opportunities."

This can have the effect of draining firms' liquidity, and in the \npresence of limited access to credit, delayed p ayments can ultimately force firms to exit the market, with \nadditional negative effects on their suppliers and customers. 25 Therefore, Subcategory 3.3.2 \u2013Time to \nReceive a Payment from a Government Contract comprises one indicator (table 31). \n \nTable 31.

These surveys \nprovide representative data on innovation in firms as well as practices on government contracts. \n \n4.2 Screening and Selection of Experts \n \nThe Market Competition topic has three questionnaires, one for each area: Competition, Innovation, and \nPublic Procurement. Each questionnaire targets experts in their respective areas of expertise. A screener \nquestionnaire is used to assist the selection of experts receiving the Market Competition topic \nquestionnaires based on a set of criteria (table 34). \n \nTable 34.\n Screener Questionnaire and Respondent Criteria \nRelevant Experts\u2019 Professions \nCompetition Corporate lawyers, legal consultants, etc. \nInnovation Intellectual property lawyers, chartered patent attorneys, etc. \nProcurement Public procurement lawyers, consultants, in-house procurement officers, etc. \nRelevant Areas of Specialization \nCompetition Antitrust/competition, abuse of dominance, merger control procedures, etc. \nInnovation Intellectual property registration and management, technology transfer, research commercialization, etc. \nProcurement Public procurement and government tenders at state, national and federal level (if applicable), etc. \nAssessment of the Experts\u2019 Knowledge and Experience Related to Competition Law, Innovation, and Procurement \nCompetition \nExperience in antitrust/competition litigation and providing advice to concerned firms; providing advice \nfor mergers and acquisitions, including litigation experience; advising on abuse of dominance matters \nincluding litigation; experience in advising firms on how to self-comply with competition law \nrequirements; experience in regulated markets \nInnovation Experience with IPR registration, management, licensing, litigation, technology transfer and research \ncommercialization \nProcurement \nExperience with public procurement at the state/national/federal level, in either an advisory, consultant, \ncompliance or litigation role; experience in bidding or assisting firms to bid for government tenders for \ngoods, services and works; experience in assessing contract awards; experience in contractual issues \nrelated to payment; experience in formal challenges and appeals procedures on public procurement \ndecisions. \nNote: IPR = Intellectual Property Rights. \n \nThus, the information provided in the screener questionnaires will allow the team to better understand the \nexperts\u2019 professions; areas of specializations and experts\u2019 knowledge or experience related to market \ncompetition, including competition, innovation, and public procurement. \n \nIV.

In particular, for the category of indicators that measure public procurement regulations and \nservices, the relevant procedures along with the public institutions that are in charge vary widely and can \ncompromise the quality and comparability of the data. \n \n5.2.1 Procurement\u2013Procuring Entity \nJustification: \nProcurement procedures and the legal framework that governs a procurement process can vary depending \non which institution is undertaking the procurement. This parameter impacts both de jure and de facto \nindicators. \n \nApplication: \nFor Pillar s I and II, i ndicators that fall within the category of public procurement are benchmarked as \napplicable to the three largest procuring entities based on the volume of tenders (number of tenders) they \nhave procured over the last three years.

The Annotated Questionnaires provide the mapping between each indicator and the \ncorresponding question(s). \n \nGlossary \n \nAbuse of dominant position: Refers to anticompetitive practices exercised by a firm that holds a significant \nmarket share to maintain or increase its position in the market, damage competition and ultimately \nnegatively affect consumer welfare. \n \nAccelerator\n: Is a program or an organization that targets high growth-oriented firms in the process of scale \nup and entails intensive mentoring accompanied by the possibility of an early-stage investment. \n \nAction for damages: Is a claim brought before a national court by a party harmed by a Competition Law \ninfringement, requesting monetary compensation for that infringement and any effects it has had upon the \ninjured party\u2019s business. \n \nAgreement on Government Procurement (GPA) : International instrument regulating the conduct of \ninternational trade in government procurement markets. It aims to ensure fair, transparent, and non-\ndiscriminatory conditions of competition for purchases of goods, services, and construction services by the \npublic entities covered by the Agreement. It also serves broader purposes of promoting good governance, \nthe efficient and effective management of public resources, and the attainment of best value for money in \nnational procurement systems. \n \nCartel: A cartel is an anti -competitive agreement or concerted practice among two or more rival firms, \nwhich aims at coordinating their behavior on the market or influencing other parameters of competition \nsuch as prices, total industry output, market shares, allocation of customers, allocation of territories, bid-\nrigging, establishment of common sales agencies, and the division of profits or combination of these. \n \nCentral purchasing body : A contracting entity that acquires goods or services (commonly through \nframework agreements) intended for several public sector entities. \n \nCollective management organization: Refers to organizations authorized to manage copyrights, or rights \nrelated to copyrights, on behalf of more than one right holder, for the collective benefit of all right holders \nwithin the organization. \n \nCompetitive neutrality: Competitive neutrality is the recognition that significant government business \nactivities that are in competition with the private sector should not have a competitive advantage or \ndisadvantage simply by virtue of government ownership and control. \n \nDesignation by threshold: Involves setting specific thresholds or criteria that define when a procurement \nprocess is designated for SMEs. For example, procurements below a certain value or size may be designated \nexclusively for SMEs, while larger procurements may be open to all businesses. \n \nDuration\n: Refers to providing specific timeframes within which the protection will be valid, either from \nthe date of registration or from the date the application is made. If the legislation provides multiple \ndurations, the one that is most protecting to the intellectual property right holder is considered. Renewal is \nnot taken into account."

MOTIVATION \n \nThe efficient and rapid exit of nonviable firms plays an important cyclical role in renewing the economy \nby removing firms that are not productive and making way for more productive ones. T he purpose of an \nefficient insolvency framework is to ensure that nonviable firms are swiftly liquidated, and viable firms are \neffectively restructured in a sustainable way. When insolvency regimes do not have the adequate tools to \nhandle the restructuring and liquidation of companies in a timely and effective manner these companies\u2019 \neconomic distress is amplified, jeopardizing the stability of the financial system. 1 In economies where \ncreditor recovery rates are high and resolution times are quicker, restructuring within the formal bankruptcy \nprocess fulfills its cyclical role during economic downturns by keeping companies afloat.2 \n \nResearch shows that efficient insolvency systems play a role in enhancing new firm creation, increasing the \nsize of the private sector, and encouraging greater entrepreneurial activity. 3 This is achieved through the \navailability of appropriate legal mechanisms that enable the cyclical role of insolvency proceedings to be \naccomplished: anticipatory early warning tools to avert financial distress; active participation of all parties \ninvolved, including the debtor, creditors, and other agents; adequate protection of creditors within the \ninsolvency processes; and effective management of the debtor\u2019s assets.\n4 Efficient insolvency systems can \nboost job creation and growth, including by spurring the reallocation of productivity- enhancing capital \nthrough the exit of nonviable firms. 5 Economies with less efficient bankruptcy procedures tend to have \nlower aggregate productivity because their bankruptcy procedures induce lenders to allocate funds to less \nproductive firms and prevent the management of risk by commercial stakeholders, thus putting pressure on \nthe financial system."

The B -READY project aims to \nfill this void. \n \nII. INDICATORS \n \nThe Business Insolvency topic measures key features of insolvency systems on a regulatory level. It also \nassesses the quality of institutional and operational infrastructure associated with insolvency proceedings \n(judicial services), as well as the operational efficiency of insolvency proceedings across three different \ndimensions, here referred to as pillars. The first pillar assesses the quality of regulation pertaining to judicial \ninsolvency proceedings, covering de jure features of a regulatory framework that are necessary for \nstructured debt resolution processes and effective creditor and debtor regimes. The second pillar measures \nthe quality of institutional and operational infrastructure for judicial insolvency proceedings, thus assessing \nthe de facto aspects of insolvency resolution mechanisms and the infrastructure required to implement the \nlegal framework on insolvency. The third pillar measures the time and cost required to resolve in- court \nliquidation and reorganization proceedings.

PARAMETERS \n \nTo ensure comparability of the data from expert consultations across economies, the Business Insolvency \ntopic uses specific parameters. A parameter refers to an assumption that is made about specific \ncharacteristics of the insolvency law and the insolvency practice. Parameters specific to the Business \nInsolvency topic are also necessary to ensure that measurements specific to the competent court and its \nlocation (the court with jurisdiction to adjudicate insolvency cases in the largest business city) and th e \ndebtor (the type of company, size, financial situation, and the number of creditors) are comparable across \neconomies. \n \n5.1 General Parameters \n \nThe Business Insolvency topic does not employ general parameters that are applicable to all pillars. \n \n5.2 Specific Parameters \n \nBusiness Insolvency employs two specific parameters. One is the competent court and its location, which \napplies in Pillars II and III. The other is the debtor company, relevant only for Pillar III. \n \n5.2.1 Competent Court and Its Location \nJustification: \nDefining the competent court is key in ensuring comparability across different economies because it \nestablishes the same level of jurisdiction over the commencement and conduct of insolvency proceedings. \nThe competent court of primary or first instance is the most comparable among jurisdictions worldwide: \nthe jurisdiction of the second instance court generally depends on the nature of the legal framework and the \njurisdiction in question, which does not allow for a comprehensive view and coherence in the data analysis. \nIn addition, because within each economy there might be a variety of subnational levels of jurisdiction over \ninsolvency procedures, the competent court assumed here is based in the largest business city of the \neconomy as the main criteria for territorial jurisdiction. \n \nApplication: \nThis parameter is applicable to all indicators in Pillars II and III. For example, an assumption of the \ncompetent court with jurisdiction to resolve insolvency disputes establishes the institution providing the \npublic services as measured in Pillar II. The most relevant institution that provide these public services must \nbe identified in as consistent and uniform a way as possible across economies to allow comparability in \nindicators related to e -courts or measurements such as the specialized bankruptcy cou rt or a \njudge/division/bench in a commercial court. In addition, an assumption related to the competent court \nspecifically located in the largest business city applies in estimating the efficiency of the in-court liquidation \nand reorganization proceedings as measured in Pillar III, because it allows standardization at the procedural \nlevel to calculate the time and cost of such proceedings. \n \n5.2.2 Debtor Company \nJustification:"

    "content": "The limited liability company (LLC) is the most prevalent legal form of company adopted worldwide to \nconduct business. LLCs can also shield the personal assets of its members from legal claims related to the \nbusiness. In other types of firm arrangements, the members and/or partners are held personally liable, which \nwould entail individual and/or personal insolvency\u2014which falls outside the ambit of corporate insolvency \nexamined in the B-READY project. Focusing solely on limited liability companies allows the relationship \nbetween creditors and debtor to be examined within the insolvency framework alone without other forms \nof liability arising. \n \nApplication: \nThe Business Insolvency topic assumes that the debtor is a domestic LLC company operating in the largest \nbusiness city in each economy. The Company has 2 Secured Creditors, which are financial institutions. \nUnsecured creditors are mainly suppliers, tax authorities, and employees. The market value of the \ncompany\u2019s assets is 150 times the GNI per capita (Atlas method) of the economy, considered a medium-\nsized enterprise. The Company sustains periods of negative cash flows and is expected to have negative net \nworth and operating losses. The value of the Company's liabilities exceeds the value of its assets, and \ndefaults on its debt obligations toward its secured and unsecured creditors as they mature. Establishing a \nstandardized debtor company, with very specific characteristics, is the only way to preserve comparability \nin measuring the time and cost of insolvency proceedings. The assumption establishing the debtor firms\u2019 \ncharacteristics is only used in Pillar III. For example, the assumption is used in estimating the length and \ncost of insolvency proceedings of liquidation and reorganizat ion, respectively. In a similar vein, an \nassumption setting the value of the company plays a central role in calculating the cost because the related \nquestion is expressed as a percentage of the value of the company. \n \nV. TOPIC SCORING \n \nThe Business Insolvency topic has three pillars: Pillar I \u2013Quality of Regulations for Judicial Insolvency \nProceedings; Pillar II \u2013Quality of Institutional and Operational Infrastructure for Judicial Insolvency \nProceedings; and Pillar III\u2013Operational Efficiency of Resolving Judicial Insolvency Proceedings. The total \nnumber of points for each pillar is further rescaled to values from 0 to 100, and subsequently aggregated \ninto the total topic score. Each pillar contributes one -third to the total topic score. The scores distinguish \nbetween benefits to the firm (captured as firm flexibility points) and benefits to society\u2019s broader interests \n(captured as social benefits points). Table 25 shows the scoring for the Business Insolvency topic. For \nfurther scoring details, please see Annex A, which complements this section. \n \nTable 25.

The scoring for each category under this pillar is as follows: \n \n6.1.1 Legal and Procedural Standards in Insolvency Proceedings has 9 indicators with a total maximum \nscore of 18 points (9 points for firm flexibility and 9 points on social benefits). Specifically, the \nPre-Commencement and Commencement Standards in Liquidation and Reorganization \nSubcategory has 4 indicators, and Post-Commencement Standards in Liquidation and \nReorganization has another 5 indicators. Comprehensive insolvency standards addressing key \nissues predating the filing for formal proceedings, defining clear standards for commencing formal \ninsolvency proceedings, and ensu ring the right balance is struck between liquidation and \nreorganization proceedings, with all processes being clearly defined, benefits both firms (firm \nflexibility) and society (social benefits). \n \n6.1.2 Debtor's Assets and Creditor's Participation in Insolvency Proceedings has 13 indicators with a \ntotal maximum score of 23 points (12 points on firm flexibility and 11 points on social benefits). \nSpecifically, the Management of Debtor\u2019s Assets during Liquidation and Reorganization (includes \nenvironment) Subcategory has 6 indicators, the Selection and Dismissal of the Insolvency \nAdministrator has 2 indicators , and the Creditor Rights in Liquidation and Reorganization \n(includes environment) Subcategory has another 5 indicators. Under this category, the score s for \nmost indicators are allocated equally between firm flexibility and social benefits, except for the \nAutomatic Stay of Proceedings and the Rejection of Existing Burdensome Contracts and Assets \nindicators, which do not extend to socially desirable outcomes, and thus score only on firm \nflexibility. In addition, the Special Regime for Labor Claims indicator scores on social benefits \nonly.

Under Specialized Insolvency \nProceedings for Micro and Small Enterprises (MSEs) , Subcategory scores are allocated equally \nbetween firm flexibility and social benefits because such a specialized regime would ensure \nexpeditious and low-cost insolvency proceedings for firms (firm flexibility) and increase judicial \nefficiency in terms of caseload by providing another legal avenue for MSEs (social benefit). Legal \nframeworks for cross-border insolvenc ies directly benefit firm s operating intern ationally. \nHowever, numerous companies operating on a domestic scale may not directly benefit from the \nexistence of a regime for cross-border insolvencies. Therefore, under the Cross-Border Insolvency \nSubcategory scores are only allocated for firm flexibility. x \n \nTable 26.

    "content": "Annex A-City Selection Parameter \n \nThe approach taken to identify the business location for each economy under the B -READY project is \nbased on population size rather than economic activity since population is more accessible to measure, and \npopulation projections are made consistently based on growth patterns. The primary data source applied \nhere is the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UN DESA), which provides regular \nupdates under its World Urbanization Prospects (WUP) online series, with the most recent revisions being \nupdated in 2018.1 \n \nWUP publishes, among others, two datasets that have been taken into consideration in selecting a n \neconomy\u2019s largest urban center: firstly, population data for all agglomerations with a population above 300 \nthousand and covering the years from 1950 to 2035; and secondly, population data for all capital cities in \n2018, the year of its most recent revisi ons.\n2 For economies with cities below 300 thousand inhabitants, \nthere are no systematically collected alternative data sources that would cover their largest cities for the \nsame year.\n3 Since capital cities may not always be the largest in terms of population, other datasets are used \nto confirm population size for all entries for cities below 300 thousand and are referenced accordingly. \n \nWUP follows the definition of \u2018urban\u2019 as applied by national statistical offices and uses three different \nconcepts: i) \u2018urban agglomeration\u2019, i.e. the contiguous territory inhabited at urban density levels in disregard \nof administrative boundaries, thus including adjacent suburban areas; ii) \u2018city proper\u2019, which refers to the \nadministrative boundaries of a city; and iii) \u2018metropolitan area\u2019, which comprises the urban agglomeration \nplus surrounding areas at a lower settlement density, but with strong economic and social linkages to the \ncentral city. Where such concepts vary within an economy, additional considerations are taken into account, \nsuch as (a) the significance of the city\u2019s business activities and its representativeness for the whole \neconomy; (b) whether the area defining the \u2018urban area\u2019 is governed by one local government, with similar \nregulations and public service rules; and (c) the feasibility of data collection, especially in fragile and \nconflict-affected states (FCS). \n \nIn addition to identifying the largest urban business center in a respective economy, the approach also \nsought to verify whether the selected city would remain the largest urban business center in the future. \nUsing the population forecasts available for cities above 300 thousand, the selection of the largest city in \n2023 was therefore compared to the largest city in 2035. All initial identifications remained valid in 2035, \nwith no need for any additional changes. \n \nFor the third cycle of the rollout phase, the selection of the largest city for each economy is displayed in the \ntable below. \nEconomy Selected City Doing Business City \nAfghanistan Kabul Kabul \nAlbania Tirana Tirana \nAngola Luanda Luanda \nAntigua and Barbuda St. John's St. John's \nArgentina Buenos Aires (Ciudad \nautonoma de) \nBuenos Aires (Ciudad \nautonoma de) \nArmenia Yerevan Yerevan \n \n1 United Nations . 2018. \u201cWorld Urbanization Prospects: The 2018 Revision .\u201d Department of Economic and Social Affairs, \nPopulation Division.

    "content": "Annex B-Aggregation and Scoring of Economy-level Variables \n \nAnnex B outlines the current approach to aggregating expert responses to generate economy-level variables \nand their corresponding scores. It also details the scoring process for indicators derived from firm-level data \nin Enterprise Surveys (ES). \n \nThe first section of this note addresses the process of aggregating expert responses to form economy-level \nvariables. This step is critical for transforming individual expert insights into a coherent, economy- wide \nperspective. \n \nThe second section discusses special cases that require specific attention during aggregation and scoring. \nThese cases arise when economy -level variables cannot be scored directly by multiplying the aggregate \nanswers with the score assigned by topic teams for a given indicator. In those cases, an economy -level \nindicator may require either bundling of questions (due to the use of logical operators) before scoring or \napplication of special scoring rules defined by topic teams. It highlights the need for a nuanced approach in \ncertain scenarios to ensure an accurate representation of the data. \n \nThe third section explains the methodology for scoring ES indicators and expert responses within Pillar 3. \nThis includes the specific processes and considerations unique to this pillar, ensuring that the scoring \nreflects the comprehensive insights from both firm-level data and expert assessments. \n \nThis annex does not cover the overall distribution of weights for indicators, subcategories, and categories \nacross different pillars. This information is presented in previous chapters on topics of this Methodology \nHandbook. \n \nI. STANDARD AGGREGATION FOR ECONOMY INDICATORS \n \n1. Binary Variables are Aggregated using the Median \n \nBinary variables \u2013 yes/no questions \u2013 are the most straightforward for aggregation. Below are exhaustive \nexamples of different scenarios that show how aggregation at the economy-level is applied. If there is a tie \nbetween an even number of respondents, 0.5 (\u201cEven split\u201d) is applied to reflect the level of uncertainty with \nrespect to the aggregated response. \n \n Scenario 1 Scenario 2 Scenario 3 Scenario 4 \nRespondent 1 1 (=yes) 1 1 0 \nRespondent 2 1 1 1 1 \nRespondent 3 0 (=no) 1 0 n/a \nRespondent 4 0 0 0 n/a \nRespondent 5 0 0 n/a n/a \nEconomy Aggregate (Median) 0 1 0.5 0.5 \nNote: n/a (not available) because of either a skip pattern, missing responses, or a limited number of respondents. \n \n2. Continuous Variables are Aggregated using the Median \n \nContinuous variables refer to variables that can take an uncountable set of numeric values. All percentage \nvariables are considered continuous, as they can take any value between integer s. Continuous variables \nfrom expert questionnaires are aggregated using the median of all responses. For the aggregation of \nEnterprise Survey continuous variables, see Annex C."

The table below show s the standard case where a single modal \noption emerges from the responses. However, the aggregation becomes more complex when no single mode \nemerges ( for example , cases where there is an even split between two options; or where there is no \nconsensus among respondents).

SPECIAL AGGREGATION AND SCORING RULES FOR ECONOMY INDICATORS \n \n1. Questions Combined using Logical Operator to form an Indicator \n \nTopics may form an indicator by combining questions using AND/OR operators. The aggregation occurs \nat the question level by taking the median, and the bundle (of medians) is scored accordingly (see scenarios \n1 & 2). When an indicator is formed by combining parent-child questions using an AND/OR operator, the \naggregation remains at the question level before bundling happens (see scenario 3). \n \nScenario 1: standalone binary questions combined using the AND operator. \n Respondent 1 Respondent 2 Respondent 3 Respondent 4 Median by question \nQ1 1 1 1 0 1 \uf0e0 MEDIAN (0,1,1,1) \nQ2 0 0 1 0 0 \uf0e0 MEDIAN (0,0,0,1) \nEconomy aggregate (under AND operator) 0 (Q1=1; Q2=0) \n \nScenario 2: standalone binary questions combined using the OR operator. \n Respondent 1 Respondent 2 Respondent 3 Respondent 4 Median by question \nQ1 1 1 1 0 1 \uf0e0 MEDIAN (0,1,1,1) \nQ2 0 0 1 0 0 \uf0e0 MEDIAN (0,0,0,1) \nEconomy aggregate (under OR operator) 1 (Q1=1; Q2=0) \n \nScenario 3 : Parent-child questions combined using AND/OR operators . In this scenario, the second \nquestion is triggered by the first one. Therefore, the second (\u201cchild\u201d) question is aggregated based on only \nthe respondents who have seen the question . For questions where only half of the respondents see the \nquestion (for example, 2 out of 4 experts), the child question\u2019s aggregate carries the structure of \u201cYes (No); \n50% skip logic.\u201d \n \n Respondent 1 Respondent 2 Respondent 3 Respondent 4 Median by question \nQ1 1 1 1 0 1 \uf0e0 MEDIAN (0,1,1,1)"

Questions Skipped by Enabling Conditions (skip logic) \n \nMost questionnaires have introduced skip patterns to allow for follow -up questions if a certain condition \nholds true (parent-child question structure).

SCORING OF CONTINUOUS VARIABLES \n \n1. Continuous Variables from Expert Questionnaire \n \nThe aggregation of continuous variables from expert questionnaires is done using the median (see Section \nI). Once an economy aggregate is obtained, depending on the indicator, the score is produced by applying \neither the linear transformation method or the normal CDF transformation method detailed below. \n \n2. Continuous Variables from Enterprise Surveys \n \nThe aggregation of continuous variables from firm -level surveys is done through weighted means or \nmedians. The means or medians are estimated using corresponding sample weights. For more details, see \nAnnex C for documentation on the World Bank Enterprise Survey (WBES) indicators. All variables from \nWBES are considered continuous, even the binary ones. This is because the aggregated response at the \neconomy-level reflects the percentage of firms choosing any one binary option. \n \nConsistent with the approach taken by WBES over the years, in most cases, the estimated mean is used to \naggregate firm responses. This ensures that governments looking to improve their score in a particular \nindicator have equal incentives to improve the condition of any firm in the economy. \n \nThe one exception to the use of the mean is the case of unbounded time and cost variables. These variables \ntend to have larger ranges driven by outliers. Depending on the specific B-READY topic and indicator, the \naggregation of firm responses to such questions may be based on the mean or median of firm response s. \nFor a list of variables aggregated with medians, see section 4 of Annex C. The median better represents the \nexperience of a typical firm in an economy, by removing distortions produced by outliers. \n \nLike the continuous variables collected through expert questionnaire s, the scores of the WBES indicators \nare produced by applying either a linear transformation or a normal cumulative density function ( CDF) \ntransformation to the economy aggregate, as detailed below. \n \n3. Scoring of the Continuous Variables \n \nThe task of scoring continuous, potentially unbounded variables into a bounded score with enough variance \nto incentivize reforms faces several challenges. The first is identifying a scoring range, i.e., the values before \nand after which an economy scores 0 or 100. It is desirable to have all indicators range from 0 to 100 so \nthat a relative improvement with respect to the global- best practice is comparable across indicators. The"

    "content": "second related challenge is identifying a scoring function. The limitations deriving from the first challenge \nrequire the use of a scoring function that allows for a degree of uncertainty around the thresholds. \n \nIdeally, the scoring range for an indicator is self -evident or well-defined in the literature. For instance, an \neconomy evidently scores maximum points on our indicator on the share of female- managed firms that \nobtained a government contract once this reaches 50%. However, these cases are rare. For most B-READY \nindicators, there is not a single globally recognized worst- or best-practice. This implies the need to define \nempirical scoring thresholds using the data collected. \n \nThe sample of 164 economies for B-READY 2026 was selected to achieve representation of all regions and \nincome groups. With a larger number of observations, the threshold\u2014instead of being fixed to thresholds \ndefined in previous reports\u2014will evolve using the data collected in the current year. \n \nThe next step in scoring is to choose a transformation. Considering the expanded sample size and additional \nresearch on threshold values in this cycle, B-READY applies a linear transformation to generate normalized \nindicator scores for all but three indicators. This approach preserves linearity, ensuring that equal changes \nin performance correspond to equal changes in score. \n \n \n \nFor three indicators in two topics (Labor and Taxation)\u2014due to the nature of variables used to construct \nthem\u2014B-READY continues to use a non- linear transformation: the normal CDF function. Firstly, this \ntransformation ensures that all present and future scores can be calculated by inputting the indicator values, \nand that the resulting score ranges between 0 and 100. Secondly, it ensures that the change in score \nassociated with the change in the variable is less prominent near the thresholds, and more prominent in the \nmiddle section. This helps reduce the impact of the specific chosen threshold on the score."

For a given indicator, an \neconomy would be considered as \u201cno practice\u201d in all instances in which the underlying public service \n(institution, procedure, function, or else) is missing, according to B -READY experts\u2019 responses to topic \nquestionnaires. Removing \u201cno practice\u201d economies avoids incentivizing the absence of a socially desirable \npublic service. O nce \u201cno practice\u201d economies are removed, all values that are more than three standard \ndeviations away from the mean of all economies are considered outliers. Removing outliers ensures \neconomies are not unduly penalized (or rewarded) due to overly large scoring ranges. The scoring range \nspans from the 5th to the 95th percentile of the remaining observations.

It follows the structure of the replication program \nprovided on the WBES website in the Stata do-file form. The subsequent processes of transforming these \nindicators into individual scores, topic, or economy- level scores are provided in Annex B of this \nMethodology Handbook. \n \n1. Data \nThe data from the most recently completed 101 WBES (The World Bank Enterprise Surveys) is used.\n1 In \nthese surveys, questions specifically designed for the B -READY report were administered, in addition to \nthe previously collected standard set of WBES questions. Each WBES is a firm -level survey of a \nrepresentative sample of an economy\u2019s private sector, where top managers or owners are interviewed about \na wide range of topics, such as access to finance, corruption, infrastructure, and performance, among others. \nFurther information about the WBES can be found on their website ; the methodology is outlined in detail \non their methodology page, with the WBES Manual and Guide providing a general overview. \nThe firm-level WBES data are publicly available from the WBES data portal , where users can create an \naccount, free of charge, to gain access. The data can be accessed in multiple ways. First, each individual \neconomy dataset can be accessed from the \u201cdata by economy\u201d tab. Second, the cross- economy database \nthat collects all WBES collected through the standardized methodology, including these 101 WBES can be \ndownloaded from the \u201ccombined data\u201d tab, the file called \u201cStandardizedNew-2006-2025-core4.zip.\u201d Note \nthat this database gets continuously updated to include the newly published WBES. \n \n2. Data Transformations \nBefore producing the WBES indicators at the firm level, the data undergo transformations to (i) handle \nsurveys that were implemented in the format of a follow -up on the baseline WBES, (ii) apply variable \ntransformations to ensure compatibility across the WBES questionnaire versions which may vary across \nyears, (iii) clean data to remove substantial extreme values and fix some discrepancies with the survey \ncodebook that were not detected during the survey implementation, and (iv) apply the outlier routine. Each \nof these components is described in detail below. Please see the replication do-file that is publicly available \non the WBES website for further details. \n \n2.1 Handling of Follow-up Surveys \nThe surveys in five economies, namely Bangladesh, Madagascar, Pakistan, Peru, and Timor-Leste, were \nimplemented as a follow -up to the baseline WBES which were completed shortly before finalizing the \nquestions necessary for the B-READY report. In these economies, the questions that were part of the pre-\n \n1 In particular, these surveys are used: Angola2024, Armenia2024, Azerbaijan2024, Bahrain2024, Bangladesh2022, Barbados2023, \nBelgium2024, Benin2024, Bhutan2024, Bosnia and Herzegovina2023, Botswana2023, Bulgaria2023, Burkina Faso2024, Cabo \nVerde2024, Cambodia2023, Cameroon2024, Canada2024, Central African Republic2023, Chad2023, Colombia2023, Congo2024, \nCosta Rica2023, Cote d'Ivoire2023, Croatia2023, Cyprus2024, Czechia2024, DRC2024, Ecuador2024, El Salvador2023, \nEquatorial Guinea2024, Estonia2023, Eswatini2024, Gambia2023, Georgia2023, Ghana2023, Greece2023, Hong Kong SAR \nChina2023, Hungary2023, Iceland2024, Indonesia2023, Ireland2024, Israel2024, Italy2024, Jamaica2024, Jordan2024, \nKazakhstan2024, Korea Republic2024, Kyrgyz Republic2023, Lao PDR2024, Latvia2024, Lesotho2023, Madagascar2022, \nMalaysia2024, Mali2024, Malta2024, Mauritius2023, Mexico2023, Moldova2024, Montenegro2023, Morocco2023, \nNamibia2024, Nepal2023, New Zealand2023, North Macedonia2023, Pakistan2022, Papua New Guinea2024, Paraguay2023, \nPeru2023, Philippines2023, Poland2025, Portugal2023, Romania2023, Rwanda2023, Samoa2023, Senegal2024, Serbia2024, \nSeychelles2023, Sierra Leone2023, Singapore2023, Slovak Republic2023, Slovenia2024, South Sudan2024, Spain2024, \nSweden2024, Taiwan China2024, Tajikistan2024, Tanzania2023, Timor -Leste2021, Togo2023, Tonga2024, Trinidad and \nTobago2025, Tunisia2024, Turkiye2024, Turkmenistan2024, United Kingdom2024, United States2024, Uruguay2024, \nUzbekistan2024, Vanuatu2023, Viet Nam2023, West Bank And Gaza2023."

    "content": "existing global WBES questionnaire were implemented during the baseline fieldwork. To administer the \nquestions necessary for the B-READY report, the same survey implementation team re-contacted the same \nrepresentative sample of firms that participated in t he baseline WBES. The follow -up surveys were \nimplemented on the phone. During this re -contacting process, some of the original respondents were \nimpossible to reach or refused to answer the additional questions. To address this attrition and ensure that \nthe surveys continue to capture the universe of firms covered by the standard WBES, the sampling weights \nwere adjusted following the standard WBES methodology. The adjusted sampling weights apply only to \nthe responses provided during the follow -up implementation, which are stored in variables with names \nsuffixed by _BR. Notably, the follow -up survey questionnaires varied slightly across the five economies . \nSince some questions were implemented as part of the baseline WBES in some of these economies, \nincluding them in the follow-ups was no longer necessary. \n \nIn addition, the WBES in Indonesia features two versions of the questionnaire, which are indicated by the \nvariable q_version in the dataset. Each firm had an equal probability of receiving either version of the \nquestionnaire. The majority of questions were administered in both versions. The questions that appear only \nin one or the other version of the questionnaire are stored i n variables with names suffixed by _BR and \nshould use the corresponding sampling weights. \nTo properly handle the above six economies, the following steps were taken: (i) for each variable, the set \nof economies where this kind of special treatment was needed was identified; (ii) for each variable and \neconomy, the responses were transferred from variables that store follow -up surveys or questionnaire \nversions into the corresponding main variables; and (iii) the variable -specific sampling weights were \nproduced, taking into account the follow-up or questionnaire version structure. \nHenceforth, the variables mentioned incorporate the above handling of the follow-up surveys. \n \n2.2 Compatibility Across the WBES Questionnaire Versions \nFor the 2025 rollout of the WBES (i.e., for the B -READY 2026), the following survey questions were \nmodified: \n\u2022 k36: As a percentage of a typical transaction, how much does it cost to accept payments, using \n<answer from a previous question>? The options \u201cabove 0 but below 0.5%\u201d and \u201ccostless\u201d were \nadded as special codes - 5 and - 6, respectively. This change allows additional granularity, as the \nWBES does not accept decimal responses. To ensure compatibility with earlier versions of the \nquestionnaire, both of these special codes are assigned a value of 0. \n\u2022 k40: As a percentage of a typical transaction, how much does it cost to make payments, using \n<answer from a previous question>? This question was modified in the same way as question k36, \nand the respective special codes are managed similarly. \n\u2022 d35: The wording of this question changed, and it was also activated for retail firms, in addition to \nmanufacturers and wholesalers. The change in wording was considered small enough to be \ncompatible, but the responses from retail firms were removed to ensure alignment with the previous \ntwo rollouts . d33a/d33b and d43a/d43b: The question D.33 regarding the duration of exported \ngoods clearing all border control agencies has been revised into two separate questions: (i) D.42, \nwhich asks whether exported goods must undergo checks before arriving at the point of exit, and \n(ii) D.43, which asks about the duration of those prior checks (with days and hours recorded in \nvariables d43a and d43b, respectively). To maintain compatibility with previous rollouts, the \noverall duration variable is calculated by summing the duration recorded in variables d43a/d43b \nand d4a/d4b, with the latter measuring duration to clearing customs. I f checks are not required \nbefore the good reach the point of exit (i.e., d42 is \u201cNo\u201d), the duration for customs clearance is \nused. This adjustment is implemented in the section of the replication program where the \ncombinations of variables are computed."

The WBES team has a highly detailed data quality control routine, which produced flags \nregarding some of these values during the fieldwork, but some were omitted due to variables being new \nand previously untested. Extreme values were removed from the following variables: \n \n\u2022 l36: How many weeks of salary was the typical severance payment for a dismissed permanent, full-\ntime worker? Please include pay and benefits but exclude unpaid salaries for time already worked. \nValues of above 300 are removed. \n\u2022 n2a2: Of [the total annual cost of labor] total annual costs of social security payments and \nemployment-based taxes, excluding employee taxes that were withheld.

Values \nwhen the reported clearance time for direct exports (d 14a and d14b) exceeds the total duration of \nborder clearances (d40a and d40b) are removed. \nFurthermore, the data was cleaned as follows: \n \n\u2022 One survey asked questions o3a and o3b, opinions regarding commercial disputes, to all firms \ninstead of only the ones that did experience such disputes as in the rest of the surveys, so the extra \nresponses were removed for the purposes of cross-economy comparability. \n\u2022 A follow-up question about the reasons for not applying for a V AT refund (j40) when the firm had \nresponded that they did apply for it (j38 response was yes) was mistakenly activated during a survey \nfor some respondents. These entries were removed. \n\u2022 The follow-up question on the hours it took to go through customs when the response of 0 days \nwas provided (variable d40b) was not activated during a survey for few observations. T he \ncorresponding empty values were turned into \u201cdon\u2019t know.\u201d Relatedly, when d40a was above 0 \ndays, but d40b was still entered as \u201cdon\u2019t know\u201d even though the follow-up d40b should not have \nbeen activated, the corresponding \u201cdon\u2019t know\u201d entries were removed. \n\u2022 The question e1 (in fiscal year [last complete fiscal year], which of the following was the main \nmarket in which this establishment sold its main product [or offered its main service]) was not \nactivated for 60 observations in total, so the corresponding values for this and the follow -up \nquestion on the number of competitors (e2b) that forms an indicator in combination with e1 were \nturned to \u201cdon\u2019t know.\u201d \n \n2.4 Outliers \nThe following outlier routine is used. First, the variable is log-transformed after adding the value of 1. Then, \nat the economy level, the simple mean and standard deviation of the variable is calculated. Finally, the \nvalues that fall further than three st andard deviations away from the mean are marked as extreme and \nremoved from the calculations. All non-categorical variables are put through this routine, in particular the \nfollowing list of variables: g3, k32, k33, k35, k36, k38, k40, the combination of d33a and d33b that calculate \nthe duration in days, d34, the combination of d40a and d40b that calculates the duration in days, d41, l35, \nl36, l38, the ratio of n2a2 and n2a, e2b, j43, the combination of j35a and j35b that calculates hours spent \non tax preparations, j33, j39, n11, c4, c7, the combination of c8a and c8b that calculates the duration in \nhours, the combination of c9a_c9b that calculates losses as a share in the total annual sales, c37, c13, and \ne31b. Please see the questionnaire for the meaning of each of these questions. \n \n3. Indicators \nThe WBES indicators used in the B -READY scores are calculated at the firm level using the interview \nresponses to the corresponding variables. There are four general types of indicators: (i) based on a Yes/No \nquestion, (ii) based on a categorical question w ith options other than Yes/No; (iii) responses with a wider \nrange, such as percentages (varying from 0 to 100), or continuous unbounded variables, such as duration \n(in weeks, days, or hours), or a number; and (iv) ratio (share of social payments in the tot al labor cost, \ncalculated by a response to one question divided by another). In almost all cases, the \u201cdon\u2019t know\u201d \nresponses are excluded from calculations. The exceptions include two trade indicators (tr18_u, tr24_u) and \none labor indicator (wk27). In the case of trade indicators, when less than one day was reported but the \nexact number of hours was not known, the value of half -day is assigned (for questions d33 and d40, \nrespectively). For the labor indicator, for backward consistency of the data, when less than one month is \nprovided but the exact number of days is not known, the value of one is assigned for backward consistency"

For additional \ninformation, please consult the questionnaires along with the WBES Indicator Descriptions document, \npublicly available on the WBES methodology page. Please see the replication program (Stata do-file) that \nis also publicly available on the WBES methodology page for further details of these calculations. \n \n4. Calculation of Economy-level Indicators \nThe means and medians at the economy level are estimated using the corresponding sampling weights. The \nmajority of indicators are aggregated using means. The following subset of indicators from category (iii) in \nSection 3 are aggregated using medians: bus3 , tax1, tax4, tax5, in3, in4, in1, in5, and in22. Several \nindicators, namely t1, t7_ml, t9_ml, and t10, are used separately for the manufacturing and services sectors. \nFor all the WBES except the six surveys mentioned in Section 2.1, the sampling weights c ontained in \nvariable wmedian are used for all the indicators, which is the standard practice of calculations of the WBES \nindicators. For the remaining six WBES, some indicators use the sampling weights associated with the \ncorresponding variable, as described in the subsection \u201c2.1 Handling of Follow-up Surveys.\u201d \nThe means and medians can be calculated using one of the following two methods. The first is through \nsetting the dataset as a survey (in Stata, this means applying the command svyset idstd [pw=wmedian], \nstrata(strata_all) singleunit(scaled), where the variable strata_all is produced using the variable strata and \neconomy to produce a code that is unique for strata and economy).\n2 After this, the weighted means and \nmedians can be calculated (in Stata, this would be svy: mean indicator, over(economy) for means, and \nepctile indicator, p(50) svy for medians applied for each economy). The second method is through applying \na simple weighted average through a command such as collapse (mean) indicator or (p50) indicator \n[pw=wmedian], by(economy). \nFor further details about the WBES indicators as entered in the B -READY scores, please consult the \nreplication program (Stata do-file) that is publicly available on the WBES website. \n \n2 As noted, for some indicators, this command would have sampling weight other than wmedian, but rather the corresponding \nquestion-specific sampling weight. See subsection \u201c2.1 Handling of Follow-up Surveys\u201d for further details."
